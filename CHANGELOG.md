User-facing release notes for CardMirror. Brief summaries of what
changes in each release, written for users of the editor. For
in-depth rationale and implementation context behind each entry,
see `DETAILED_CHANGELOG.md`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Learn — flashcards & review (early).** Turn evidence into spaced-
  repetition flashcards without leaving the editor.
  - **Create Flashcard** (a button in the ribbon's comments group, the
    command palette, or a bound key): with text selected, anchor a new
    card to it. Pick **Q & A** (a question and an
    answer) or **Cloze** (one sentence with the deletion wrapped in
    `{{double braces}}`). The answer field pre-fills with the selected
    text. Cards are due immediately.
  - **Review** from the Home screen's **Learn** section: a "Review all
    due" card plus a per-file / per-deck breakdown of whatever's due
    today. A session shows one card at a time — Space reveals the
    answer, then **1 = Forgot** / **2 = Remembered** (binary grading).
    A forgotten card comes back later in the same session.
  - **In the document** — open the comments pane and the text a card is
    anchored to is highlighted; the card appears in the column next to
    it, alongside any comments, and clicking it reveals the answer. Edit,
    suspend, or delete a card right there. If an edit (yours or a
    collaborator's) breaks a card's anchor, it drops into an
    **"Unanchored"** section at the bottom of the pane showing the text
    it was attached to, with a **Re-ground** button — select new text and
    click it to re-attach. It won't silently re-attach to an unrelated
    passage that happens to share the same words. A broken anchor never
    affects the card's review schedule.
  - **Manage flashcards** (Home → Learn, or the command palette): browse
    every card grouped by the file it's anchored to — so you can see
    which cards belong to which document — filter by text, edit a card's
    question/answer, suspend/resume it, or delete it. **New card** makes
    a standalone card not tied to any document. Cards shared across files
    (via Save As) are marked, and an "Unanchored" group collects
    standalone cards and any whose text reference is gone. An unanchored
    card has a **link** button: pick a file to attach it to (CardMirror
    quietly tags the file with a hidden id if it doesn't have one), then
    ground it to specific text later from inside that file.
  - Flashcards live in a **private, per-user layer on your machine** —
    they are never written into the document and never travel in
    comments, so sharing a `.docx`/`.cmir` never leaks your cards.
    Documents keep a stable hidden id (it survives a round-trip through
    Word) so your cards re-associate with the right file; the id is
    written into the file as soon as you create or link a card (no
    separate save needed). **Save As** forks a copy's cards alongside the
    new file. Works the same in single-document windows and the
    multi-pane workspace.

- **Smoother comments column** — comment (and flashcard) cards now shift
  around each other smoothly when one expands, collapses, or changes
  height, instead of jumping, and stay reliably positioned next to their
  text as you edit. Typing in a reply no longer loses focus on unrelated
  updates.

- **Modern icons** — the toolbar, banners, dialogs, and status bar now
  use a clean line-icon set (Untitled UI) that takes on the active
  theme color, replacing the old mix of emoji and text symbols. New
  under Settings → Appearance → **Icon style**: pick **Modern** (the
  new default) or **Classic** to bring back the original emoji/text
  glyphs. The choice affects the app's chrome only — your documents are
  untouched.

- **Bulk convert** (desktop) — a Home-screen button (under its own
  "Convert" heading, beside Quick Cards) that batch-converts between
  `.docx` and `.cmir`. Choose the direction, an input (a single file or
  a whole folder, recursed through subfolders), and a destination
  folder; then Convert. Output is either loose files (swapped
  extension, mirroring the input's subfolder structure) or a single
  `.zip`, both written into the destination you pick. The chosen input
  and destination paths are shown before you convert. Comments carry
  across the conversion.

- **Quick Cards** — a persistent, cross-window library of reusable
  rich-text snippets (think Verbatim's quick cards), reached from a
  new 2×2 ribbon cluster (Search / Tag Picker / Manage / Add) between
  the speech-doc buttons and the structural styles.
  - **Add** (button, or bind a key in Settings → Keybindings): with
    text selected, save it as a quick card. The name pre-fills with
    the smallest enclosing heading; you can tag it (Enter or comma
    between tags). A name may repeat only if its tags differ.
  - **Search** (**Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Space**, or the 🔍 button; press again
    to close): a floating palette over the current document. Type to
    search everything, or scope with a prefix — `q ` for quick cards,
    `d ` for the dropzone, `c ` for **commands** (anything bindable to
    a keyboard shortcut; the result shows its current binding, and
    selecting it runs the command), `s ` for **settings**, and `f ` for
    **files** (desktop). Matches on name first, then contents; ↑/↓ to
    move, **Enter** to insert (or run a command / open a setting / open
    a file), **Alt+Enter** to insert at the end of the doc, Esc to
    close. **Tab** jumps to an inline tag filter (type to filter, ↑/↓ +
    Enter to toggle, Esc to return).
    - `s ` **settings** finds both the top-level settings sections
      (General, Appearance, …) and individual settings by name;
      selecting one opens that tab, scrolled to and briefly
      highlighting the setting.
    - `f ` **files** (desktop) finds `.cmir` files by name under a
      folder you set in Settings → General → "File search folder"
      (searched recursively). Enter opens a file in a new window (or the
      slot picker in multi-pane), leaving your current document
      untouched; **Tab** dives into the highlighted file. With the bar
      empty you get the file's outline (its pocket → hat → block → tag
      hierarchy, indented like the nav pane) to browse — right-click (or
      click the chevron on) any pocket / hat / block to expand or
      collapse it, and set how deep it opens by default via Settings →
      General → "File search: default outline depth" (default Block, the
      same idea as the nav pane). Start typing to search the cards,
      blocks, and cites inside the file. Inserting a match
      (Enter, like a quick card) keeps the palette open and the file
      loaded, so you can pull several blocks in a row — Ctrl/Cmd+Z undoes
      the last one without leaving the bar; Esc returns to the file list
      with your prior search intact. Which object types appear in search
      is configurable in Settings. The file list is cached between
      searches (and across launches), but there's no content index yet,
      so the first dive into a large file may feel slow.
    - **Pinning / warm files:** to make the files you use most feel
      instant, CardMirror keeps a small set "warm" (parsed and held in
      memory). **Pin a file** with the ★ on its row or **Alt+P** —
      pinned files stay warm and float to the top of `f`. It also
      auto-warms your recent and frequently-used files (the most recent
      6 + up to your top 10 by use); turn that off in Settings → General
      → "File search: auto-pin recent & frequent files" if you'd rather
      keep only hand-pinned files warm. Diving into a warm file is
      instant — no re-parse.
  - **Tag Picker** (🏷️): choose which tags are in scope for search —
    handy when, say, several aff files each have a "2AC" card. The
    filter is global and persists.
  - **Manage** (🗂️, or the Home screen): a full-window browser to
    edit a card's name / tags / content (in an embedded editor),
    delete, and import/export as JSON.
  - Quick cards persist across sessions and are shared live across all
    open windows. Inserting into the middle of a paragraph asks for
    confirmation first; disable that via **Settings → Editing →
    "Skip mid-text confirm when inserting quick cards."**

- **Select Current Heading** and **Copy Current Heading** commands.
  Each acts on the card, analytic, or heading (plus its subtree) your
  cursor is in — the same structure Send to Speech / Send to Dropzone
  target. They key off the cursor and **ignore any active selection**. 
  "Select" highlights that structure; "Copy" puts it on the
  clipboard without moving your cursor. Both ship **unbound** — assign
  keys via Settings → Keybindings.

- **Home screen.** Launching CardMirror without a file now opens
  a start screen instead of a blank document: New document, New
  speech document, Open, and a list of recently opened files
  (click to reopen in place). A **Home button** (🏠, in the
  ribbon's top-right button cluster; rebindable via Settings →
  Keybindings) returns to it any time — with a "Back to document"
  link and Esc to dismiss back to what you were editing. On the
  home screen, **1 / 2 / 3** trigger New / New speech / Open.
  **Ctrl+W** (single-doc) now closes the current doc back to the
  home screen rather than closing the window (the window's close
  button still quits); confirms unsaved changes first. Available
  in multi-pane mode too — there the Home button's actions route
  through the slot picker instead of loading in-place. Recent
  files persist across restarts. On the web edition, recents show
  but can't be reopened directly (browser file handles aren't
  persistable yet).

- **Grayscale text antialiasing on high-DPI displays** (DPR ≥
  1.5 — Retina, most modern phones, HiDPI Windows / Linux
  scaled past 150%). On those displays the chrome and editor
  text now render with `font-smooth: grayscale` (via
  `-webkit-font-smoothing` and `-moz-osx-font-smoothing`),
  which matches the macOS system default since Mojave and
  produces a thinner, lighter glyph consistent with the rest
  of the OS. Low-DPI displays keep the browser-default
  subpixel rendering, which is crisper at that resolution.
- **Dropzone shelf** — opt-in floating pill in the editor's
  bottom-left corner (Settings → Appearance → "Show dropzone shelf in
  nav pane"; **default off**). When enabled, drag any card or
  heading onto the pill to absorb it into a cross-window shelf;
  click the pill to expand the shelf in place, click an item to
  insert it at the cursor (Alt+click to insert at end of doc),
  or drag an item out to drop it at a specific position in the
  editor / nav pane. **Ctrl+\`** (rebindable as `sendToDropzone`)
  sends the current selection or enclosing card/heading to the
  shelf even when the pill is hidden — items pile up in the
  store and become accessible the moment any window turns the
  pill on. Card items show the same tag + cite preview the nav
  pane uses; pocket / hat / block / analytic items show the
  heading text only. Shared across every CardMirror window in
  the same session; survives the renderer reload that toggling
  multi-pane mode triggers; does NOT persist between app
  restarts. On web, single-window only with `sessionStorage`
  survival.
- **Searchbar on Settings → Keybindings and the Keyboard
  Shortcuts reference modal.** Filters rows live against the
  command label AND its current keybinding text (searching "f7"
  surfaces every command bound to F7; "highlight" surfaces
  every command whose label contains it). Empty group sections
  collapse out of view so the surviving rows always read as a
  single coherent list.
- **Application menu bar overhaul** (desktop app):
  - **File** is now Open / New / Save / Save As / Toggle
    Autosave / Close.
  - **New Speech menu** between File and Edit holds the four
    speech-cluster actions plus a new **Select Speech Doc…**
    entry.
  - **Edit's Redo** is now `Ctrl/Cmd+Y` (was `Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+Z`;
    both still fire redo via the editor's keymap).
  - **View's Zoom In / Out / Reset** now point at the editor's
    `chromeScale*` commands (so the menu accelerators match what
    the keys actually do, instead of triggering Chromium's
    separate page-zoom).
  - **Window menu removed.**
  - **Help** gains Settings and Keyboard Shortcuts entries at
    the top.
  - **Every menu accelerator now tracks your current keybinding.**
    Rebinding a command in Settings → Keybindings updates the
    accelerator label shown next to its menu item — including
    the previously-static File entries.
- **Select Speech Doc** (Speech menu): new modal that lists
  every open document across every CardMirror window, marks the
  current speech doc with a gold accent, and lets you reassign
  or clear the designation. Picking a doc doesn't switch you to
  it; you stay where you are. No default keyboard shortcut —
  rebind via Settings → Keybindings if you want one.
- **Ribbon tooltips are now configurable** in Settings →
  Appearance → "Ribbon tooltips," with four modes:
  - **Label and shortcut** (default) — `Apply Tag Style (F7)`.
  - **Label only** — just the action name.
  - **Shortcut only** — just `F7`; buttons without a shortcut
    show no tooltip.
  - **No tooltips** — disables ribbon tooltips entirely.
  
  The displayed shortcut now tracks user rebinds (Settings →
  Keybindings) for every ribbon button, not just the
  formatting-panel buttons. Dropdown menu items (Doc / Card /
  Table) now also expose the current shortcut on hover —
  shortcut-only on those, since the menu label already says
  what the action does.
- **Interface font is now configurable** in Settings →
  Accessibility → "Interface font." Pick any of the body-font
  picker's familiar groups (readability fonts, Office defaults,
  Apple defaults, etc.) and the choice cascades to every UI
  surface — ribbon, dialogs, navigation pane, comments column,
  status bar, menus, tooltips. Default is the platform's
  system-UI font stack so the chrome blends with other native
  apps; "System default" stays selectable as a sentinel to
  return there. Independent of the editor body font.
- **Highlight Acronym command (Alt+F11).** Counterpart to
  Emphasize Acronym (now Alt+F10): expands the selection to
  whole-word boundaries, then applies the active highlight color
  to the first character of each word. Useful for visually
  popping the source letters of an acronym ("United States
  Capitol Police" → U, S, C, P each carry the active highlight).
  Unlike Emphasize Acronym, this works in structural blocks
  (tags, analytics, pockets) too, since highlight is a runtime
  annotation rather than a body-only named style.

### Changed

- **Comments, flashcards, and AI notes now share one card design.** Every
  card in the comments pane leads with a small **type chip** — `COMMENT`,
  `Q&A`/`CLOZE`, or `AI` — color-matched to the highlight it sits on
  (gold / blue / purple). Collapsed cards show just the chip and a
  one-line preview; expanding a comment or AI note brings back the round
  author avatars, so the question that *opens* a thread reads apart from
  the replies (an AI note's first question is no longer styled as a reply
  to nothing). The open card now glows in its own color. Delete is an `✕`
  on comments and AI notes and a confirm-press **Delete** on flashcards;
  on an AI note, **Convert to Flashcard** is now a prominent button under
  Reply. The reply box now has a compact **send** button at its right
  edge, and each card shows its date next to the type chip.

- **"Ask AI about selection" notes are now private to you.** AI
  explanations no longer live as comments in the document — they're kept
  in the same per-user, on-your-machine layer as flashcards, so they
  never get written into a `.docx`/`.cmir` you share (sending a file
  no longer leaks your AI Q&A). It works the same as before: select
  text, ask, and follow up in a back-and-forth — but the thread shows
  up as a purple note in the comments pane, under your AI persona's name
  with an **AI** chip (no more `(AI)` tacked onto the name), anchored to
  the text and following it as you edit (dropping into the **Unanchored**
  list with a **Re-ground** button if its text is deleted). Existing AI *comments*
  in older documents are left as-is. (Typing `@AI` inside a regular
  comment still works the usual way, as a comment.) **Ask AI about
  selection** has a ribbon button now (in the comments group, shown only
  while AI features are enabled), alongside Create Flashcard. An active AI
  note also
  has a **Convert to Flashcard** button: it asks the AI for a flashcard
  (a Q&A or a cloze, whichever fits) capturing what you were exploring —
  drawing on your questions and the card's tag to aim at what *you* cared
  about — then opens the create-flashcard editor pre-filled so you can
  tweak or just confirm. The new card is anchored to the same text as the
  AI note.

- **Save As dialog reorganized around presets.** **Name** and
  **Format** sections sit at the top; a **Save** section below
  offers three one-click save buttons — **As-Is** (everything),
  **Send Doc** (excludes analytics, undertags, and comments), and
  **Read Doc** (exports the read-mode view), each with a short
  description beneath it — saving immediately with the name and
  format above. A **Custom Save** block (comments / analytics /
  undertags checkboxes + a **Save Custom** button) remains below for
  hand-picking what to keep; Cancel sits at the bottom. The separate
  read-mode checkbox is gone, folded into the Read Doc preset.
  Saving via the **Send Doc** / **Read Doc** presets prepends
  `SEND_` / `READ_` to the file name (e.g. `SEND_1AC.docx`) by
  default — toggle off via **Settings → General → "Prefix preset
  saves with SEND_ / READ_"**. As-Is and Save Custom are never
  prefixed.

- **Emphasize Acronym moved from Ctrl+F10 to Alt+F10.** Frees
  Ctrl+F10 and makes room for Highlight Acronym on Alt+F11
  next to it. Rebind via Settings → Keybindings if you've been
  using the Ctrl chord.

### Fixed

- **Your selection stays visible when a palette or the find bar opens.**
  Selecting text and then opening the command / search palette (or any
  panel that takes keyboard focus) used to grey out or hide the
  selection, because the editor lost focus. It now stays highlighted, so
  you can see what a command will act on.

- **Pasted sections now work in the navigation pane.** When you copied
  pockets/hats/blocks (and the cards under them) from one document and
  pasted them into another, the pasted headings were inert in the
  destination's outline — you couldn't expand/collapse them (they stayed
  permanently open), couldn't jump to them, and the 1/2/3/4 level buttons
  ignored them. Pasted headings now get fresh internal ids (the copy step
  was dropping them), so they behave like any other heading.

- **After dragging a card to a new spot, the editor jumps to it.**
  Previously the view jumped to a seemingly random place after a
  drag-and-drop (it followed wherever your cursor happened to be before
  the drag, not the moved content), so a successful move often left you
  looking at the wrong part of the document. Now a drop lands you exactly
  where clicking that section's heading in the outline would — its first
  heading pinned to the top of the view — for both moves and copies, in
  single-document windows and across panes.

- **The outline's blue "you are here" highlight now follows big edits.**
  After a structural change like dragging a section to a new spot, the
  navigation pane could highlight the wrong heading (it scanned cached
  positions that hadn't caught up with the move) and stayed wrong until
  you next moved the cursor. It now re-checks once the outline rebuilds,
  so the highlight lands on the heading your cursor is actually in.

- **Large `.docx` files no longer fail to open with "Entity
  expansion limit exceeded".** The XML parser shipped a "billion
  laughs" safety cap that counted every ordinary `&amp;` / `&lt;` /
  `&gt;` / `&quot;` / `&apos;` toward a 1000-per-document budget, so
  big files (multi-tournament affs, large generics) tripped a
  malware-defense limit on perfectly valid content. The cap is
  lifted for import — standard entities are harmless 1:1
  replacements, and the documents we open are trusted local files.
- **Saving a Send Doc / Read Doc no longer renames the document
  you're working on.** Previously, saving via a content-dropping
  preset (or a partial Save Custom) rebound the open document's
  identity to the exported file's name — so the working doc thought
  it was named e.g. `SEND_1AC`, and trying to open that export was
  blocked by the "already open" guard. Now only a full-fidelity save
  (everything included, not read-mode) adopts the saved file as the
  document's name/handle; a derived export writes its own file
  (and shows up in Recent) while the working doc keeps its name,
  unsaved-changes state, and crash-recovery journal.
- **Settings → Keybindings list stays put when you rebind.**
  Capturing a new shortcut (or hitting × on a chip, or ↺ to
  restore defaults) used to rebuild the list and snap the
  panel back to the top — losing the row you were working on.
  The rebuild now preserves the surrounding scroll position.
- **Settings modal tab strip now scrolls with arrows instead
  of overflowing the dialog.** When the dialog is narrow enough
  that the tab labels don't fit, a left and right arrow appear
  on either side of the tab list; clicking either scrolls the
  tabs by about half the visible width. Each arrow disables
  when there's nothing more to scroll in its direction. When
  the tabs fit, the arrows disappear entirely. No native
  scrollbar.
- **Ribbon panel button gaps are now consistent** across every
  multi-button panel. The color panel was 4px and the
  format-menu panel (Table / image / sub / sup / strike) was
  2px while every other panel used 3px; both now use 3px so
  the spacing rhythm reads the same from left to right. Row
  gaps were already a uniform 2px and are unchanged.
- **Formatting panel (Pocket / Hat / Block / Tag / Analytic /
  Undertag) buttons are now equal-width**, so the visual
  rhythm between Pocket → Hat → Analytic stays uniform whether
  style preview is on or off. Previously the columns auto-
  sized to their widest occupant (Block is narrower than
  Analytic, so col 2 ended up tighter than col 3), and with
  style preview off the eye picked that up as asymmetric
  spacing.
- **Timer toggle now sits 3px from the settings / shortcuts
  stack** on the right side of the ribbon (was 5.6px from the
  default `.ribbon-section` flex-gap), matching the intra-
  panel column-gap used everywhere on the left side.
- **Ribbon panels now collapse one panel sooner**, so the
  rightmost visible panel no longer sits flush against the
  right-pinned buttons (timer / settings / reference). The
  progressive-hide overflow check reserves a small buffer —
  matched to the column-gap *inside* a single panel — so the
  spacing between the rightmost panel and the pinned right
  elements reads as the same visual unit as the spacing
  between buttons within a panel.
- **F9 / F10 / F11 (and the other formatting commands) now
  format a deliberately-selected trailing space instead of
  no-op-ing.** The Layer 3 trim that shaves the absorbed
  trailing space off a word selection used to fire even when
  the entire selection was whitespace, turning the operating
  range into empty and causing the command to no-op. The trim
  now skips when the range minus its trailing space has no
  non-space content — so selecting just ` ` (or any all-
  whitespace run) formats the spaces. Selections with word
  content still get exactly one trailing space shaved, same as
  before.
- **AI cite creator always lands the formatted cite in its own
  paragraph.** Previously, if the selection ended mid-paragraph
  or spanned a paragraph break, the formatted cite would inherit
  whatever trailing text was left in the textblock and merge
  with the paragraph after. The cite is now split out cleanly:
  any pre-cite text in the surrounding textblock stays as its
  own paragraph before, any post-cite text stays as its own
  paragraph after, and the cite is alone in the middle.
- **Viewport no longer rockets to the doc end after a paste or
  F7 wrap that triggers card-body absorption.** The card-body
  absorption rule (paragraphs and friends after a `card` get
  absorbed into it) was wholesale-rewriting the doc in a single
  `replaceWith(0, content.size, rebuilt)` transaction, and PM's
  default selection mapping for that shape pushed the cursor to
  the END of the rebuilt content. Absorb now does the same
  rewrite as two surgical steps per region (insert the absorbed
  bodies inside the card, then delete the doc-level orphans), so
  PM's mapping leaves the cursor in place. Affects any sequence
  that creates absorbable doc-level paragraphs near the
  cursor — F7 above orphan paragraphs, paste that lifts content
  to doc level, manually-built docs with pre-existing orphans.
- **Pasting multi-line text into the middle of a card_body that
  has sibling card_bodies no longer splits the card.** PM's
  default slice fitting was bubbling the multi-paragraph split
  up to the card level, producing a phantom empty-tag card
  carrying the trailing siblings. The paste handler now
  pre-fits the slice into `card_body` children when the cursor
  is in a card_body context, so the split stays cleanly inside
  the card.
- **Copy Last Cite now lands where the cursor visually is when
  the cursor sits at the start of a paragraph.** Previously, at
  offset 0 of a body / cite / undertag / doc-level paragraph,
  the new cite was inserted AFTER that paragraph — so in a
  multi-paragraph card with no cite, putting the cursor at the
  start of the first body and copying the last cite sent the
  cite to the wrong slot (between body 1 and body 2 instead of
  between the tag and body 1). The command now inserts the cite
  BEFORE the paragraph in that boundary case. Cursor
  mid-paragraph or at the end of a paragraph still inserts
  after, as before.
- **Ctrl+Left / Ctrl+Right with an active selection now snap
  to the WORD edge of the selection's relevant corner**, instead
  of just collapsing to the corner. If the corner sits INSIDE a
  word (e.g., you've selected "The" inside "Therefore"), the
  cursor jumps to the end of that word (Ctrl+Right) or the start
  of that word (Ctrl+Left). If the corner is already at a word
  boundary, the keystroke just collapses there with no further
  motion — same as before. Shift-extend variants are unchanged.
- **Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down with an active selection no longer
  skips into the adjacent paragraph.** Same idea as the
  Ctrl+Left/Right change above, one notch coarser: snap to the
  start (Up) or end (Down) of the paragraph that's actually
  visually part of the selection. Ctrl+Down in particular knows
  that after Ctrl+Shift+Down the selection's bottom edge sits
  at the very start of the paragraph *below* the visual
  selection (because the extend goes to the next paragraph's
  start, not the current one's end) and snaps to the previous
  paragraph's end accordingly. Shift-extend variants are
  unchanged.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4 — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Selection model now follows Word's actual rules instead of
  the browser's regex-style word boundaries.** Affects every
  spot where the editor decides "what counts as a word":
  whole-word Find / Replace, the F7 / F8 / F10 cursor-expansion
  commands, and the keyboard + mouse selection gestures
  described separately below. The rules in brief: letters,
  digits, `'` (U+0027), and `'` (U+2019) are word characters;
  `_`, `.`, `,`, `:`, `;`, `-`, em / en dashes, ellipses, and
  `'` (U+2018) are NOT (they break words). So `user_name` is
  two words, `1,234` is three, `U.S.A.` is three (each letter
  alone), `H2O` is one, `don't` / `we're` are one each.
  Whole-word Find of "don" no longer matches "don" inside
  "don't", and "user" now matches "user" inside "user_name".
  F10 Emphasize Acronym on "U.S.C.P." now emphasizes U, S, C,
  P (instead of just U).
- **Mouse selection now uses Word's selection state machine.**
  Double-click selects a unit (word + trailing space, with the
  spec's class rules — `don't` selects as one word, `U.S.A.` as
  three) and dragging extends word-by-word with the original
  word staying fully selected when the drag reverses. Single-
  click + drag starts character-granularity; pulling past the
  clicked word's boundary upgrades to word granularity (and
  pulls the rest of that word in); pulling back inside
  downgrades to character. Triple-click selects a paragraph;
  dragging extends paragraph-by-paragraph, and shift+click
  after a triple-click extends paragraph-by-paragraph the same
  way (matching triple-click + drag). Shift+click after a
  single or double click extends with whatever granularity was
  set (drag and shift+click are the same operation). Shift+
  double-click and shift+triple-click are no-ops.
- **Keyboard navigation now uses Word's per-unit nav.**
  - `Ctrl+Left` / `Ctrl+Right` (`Alt+Left/Right` on Mac): jump
    to the start of the previous / next unit using the
    spec-compatible word iterator (so `don't` is one unit,
    `U.S.A.` is three, `user_name` is two). Trailing space
    absorbs into the unit it follows, so one `Ctrl+Right` from
    the start of `help to` lands just before `to`, and the
    symmetric `Ctrl+Left` rewinds. With an existing selection
    and no Shift, `Ctrl+Left/Right` collapses to the
    appropriate edge (same as plain Left/Right) instead of
    jumping by a unit — matches Word. Shift-variants extend.
  - `Ctrl+Up` (`Alt+Up`): go to the start of the current
    paragraph; if already there, the previous paragraph (Word's
    asymmetric "stop on current first" behavior).
  - `Ctrl+Down` (`Alt+Down`): go to the start of the next
    paragraph.
  - `PageUp`: same shape as `Ctrl+Up` but at the heading level —
    go to the start of the current heading marker (the most
    recently passed pocket / hat / block / tag / analytic);
    if already there, the previous heading marker. Useful for
    skipping over body content to land on the next structural
    anchor.
  - `PageDown`: go to the start of the next heading marker.
  - All paired with `Shift+` variants that extend the selection
    instead of collapsing.
  - `Home / End` (visual line start / end) and `Ctrl+Home /
    Ctrl+End` (doc start / end) are left on the browser default,
    which already matches the spec.
- **Formatting commands skip the selection's trailing space.**
  When you double-click "word" Word selects "word + space" and
  bolding bolds the word only — that behavior now applies in
  CardMirror across every formatting command (bold, italic,
  underline, cite, emphasis, highlight, shading, font size,
  font color, clear-formatting, and friends). A multi-word
  selection like "the quick fox " loses the trailing space
  from the formatting only — internal spaces stay formatted.
- **Opening a file that's already loaded surfaces the existing
  copy instead of opening a duplicate.** Picking the same file
  from the Open dialog (ribbon or per-slot "+ Open file" button)
  brings the existing copy into focus, shows its slot if it was
  in a stack, and toasts "<filename> is already open." rather
  than spawning a second copy with its own undo history and
  edits. The guard covers cross-window duplicates too: opening a
  file that's already loaded in a DIFFERENT CardMirror window
  focuses that window for you instead of opening another copy.
  Files without an on-disk handle (never-saved docs) aren't
  deduped — they have no identity to compare against yet.
- **Comments work in multi-pane mode.** A single shared comments
  column sits to the right of the three pane slots — visually a
  narrow fourth slot that shrinks the doc slots equally. Threads
  shown follow focus: click, drag, Ctrl+Tab, or Ctrl+1/2/3 — the
  column repaints with the new doc's threads. Add Comment, Ask
  AI, and the comments toggle all work the same as in
  single-pane. Cards re-layout against the focused pane's scroll
  so each card stays aligned with the heading it annotates.
- **Ctrl+1 / 2 / 3 — focus the named multi-pane slot.** No-op
  when the slot is empty. Rebindable in Settings → Keybindings.
- **Ctrl+Shift+1 / 2 / 3 — send the focused slot's visible doc
  to slot 1 / 2 / 3.** Mirrors the Ctrl+1 / 2 / 3 focus chord.
  Source slot collapses to its next-visible doc or empties; the
  moved doc keeps its cursor, selection, undo history, and
  unsaved-edits state. No-op when the focused slot is empty or
  when the target is the source slot itself. Rebindable in
  Settings → Keybindings.
- **Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab — cycle docs within the focused
  multi-pane slot** (when the slot holds 2+ docs). Holding
  Ctrl after pressing Ctrl+Tab shows an Alt+Tab-style overlay
  centered over the focused slot's pane, with each doc in the
  stack listed top-to-bottom; each Tab while Ctrl is held
  advances the highlight, releasing Ctrl commits the
  highlighted doc as visible, Escape cancels. List items show
  the filename plus a small blue dot when the doc has unsaved
  changes. Wraps around at both ends. Web users without the
  chord (browsers reserve it for tab cycling): use
  Ctrl+Alt+Tab — same handler accepts both shapes, so it also
  works on desktop. The chord itself is fixed — hold-and-press
  semantics don't fit the discrete-press rebindable-command
  model.
- **Ctrl+Shift+F — toggle expand-mode** on the focused
  multi-pane slot (same behavior as clicking the chip's ⛶
  expand button). Rebindable in Settings → Keybindings.
- **Ctrl+W — close the focused multi-pane doc** (or the entire
  window if no slot is focused / the focused slot is empty).
  Rebindable in Settings → Keybindings.
- **Slot number badge on each multi-pane chip** — a small `1` /
  `2` / `3` glyph immediately left of the expand button.
  Disambiguates which slot a chip belongs to when only some
  slots are occupied.
- **Exported .docx files now open as Verbatim-ready.** When a
  Verbatim user opens a CardMirror-saved .docx in Word, the
  Debate ribbon activates immediately — no need to click the
  Verbatimize button first. Works on both Mac and Windows
  Verbatim installs. Verbatim's own files, manually-Verbatimized
  files, and CardMirror's now-Verbatimized files all read the
  same way for users.
- **Emphasize Acronym (Ctrl+F10).** New ribbon command. Select
  any text (or a partial word — the selection auto-expands to
  whole-word boundaries) and the first letter of every word in
  the range gets the Emphasis style applied. Useful for marking
  the source letters of an acronym: select "United States
  Capitol Police", press Ctrl+F10, and U / S / C / P are
  emphasized. Selection-only — no-op without a selection, and
  no-op if the selection is entirely whitespace.
- **Keybindings editor (Settings → Keybindings) is now grouped
  by category** — same 17-section taxonomy as the Keyboard
  Shortcuts reference modal (File, Speech, Structural styles,
  Character styles, Inline formatting, Condense, Editing
  utilities, Highlight tools, Color pickers & menus, Find, View,
  Zoom & scale, Comments, AI, Select, Cleanup, Table). Each
  group's heading sticks to the top of the scrollable list as
  you scroll. Previously the editor rendered every command as
  one alphabetical flat list.
- **Resizable comments column.** Drag the column's left edge to
  resize it (240 – 560 px). The col-resize cursor appears when
  you hover near the edge. Persists across sessions via the new
  `commentsColumnWidth` setting.
- **Nav-pane highlight follows the editor cursor.** Previously
  the blue highlight only updated when you clicked a nav-pane
  entry. Now it tracks whichever heading's section contains the
  cursor — moving the caret, typing into a new heading, clicking
  in the editor, and find-next all update the highlight.
  Ctrl/Shift-click multi-selection still works but collapses on
  the next caret move (matches "the highlight shows where the
  cursor is").

### Fixed

- **Round-tripped .docx files with hyperlinks no longer open as
  corrupted in Word.** URLs containing `&` (very common in
  query-string-heavy citation links — multiple `&`-separated
  parameters) were being written into the hyperlink Target
  attribute without XML-escaping, producing malformed XML.
  Word recovered the doc body but flagged it as corrupted on
  open, and images attached to that doc could fail to display.
  Now properly escapes `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'` in all
  hyperlink and image relationship Targets.
- **Plain-paste no longer jumps the viewport to the doc end.**
  Pasting text that contained a line break (the common case:
  triple-clicking an article title in the browser, which grabs
  a trailing newline) into a tag / cite / undertag / analytic
  used to split the surrounding card at the newline boundary
  and scroll-to-bottom. Plain-paste now flattens internal
  whitespace to single spaces (and trims edges) when the target
  is a single-line block; multi-paragraph blocks like card_body
  still preserve intentional paragraph splits from the
  clipboard.
- **Comments column now extends through the full scroll
  height.** Was rendering only at the top of the document and
  cutting off below. Same family of post-path-A regression as
  the multi-doc top-shift and recovery-sidebar offset fixed
  during alpha.3 — `#app` becoming the bounded scroller meant
  the inner flex layout's cross-axis was viewport-bounded,
  leaving the column's box (and background strip) stranded at
  the top.
- **Comments column on short / empty documents no longer looks
  truncated.** Inner layout now sizes to max(viewport, content),
  so the column's background fills the visible area even when
  the doc has nothing in it.

### Changed

- **AI comments are now identified by name and initials, not by
  an invisible flag** — the initials badge always reads `AI`, and
  the author name has `(AI)` appended (e.g. `Clod (AI)` when a
  custom persona name is set). Previously the AI-ness lived on a
  `kind` field that didn't survive a docx round-trip, so AI
  comments lost their purple styling after being saved to Word
  and re-opened. The new identifiers ride along through docx
  naturally. The small "AI" tag that used to appear next to the
  author name is gone — redundant now that `(AI)` is in the
  name itself. Existing AI comments saved before this change
  still display as AI through a legacy back-compat check.

### Removed

- **Bottom-left collapse/expand toggle in the comments column**
  (the small ▾/▴ circle). Active-comment collapse still works
  by clicking outside the sticky card; the "re-expand most
  recent thread" affordance the button provided is gone.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3 — 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Setting: Format nav pane entries by type** (Settings →
  Appearance, on by default). Turn off for a uniform nav-pane
  list where only indentation conveys hierarchy — no bold
  top-level headings, no analytic-blue accent, no per-level
  size shifts. Display-only; the underlying doc is untouched.
- **Setting: Check for updates on launch** (desktop only,
  Settings → General → "About this install"). Off by default —
  opt in if you want the app to check for a new release at boot.
  When enabled, the first window of each app session does a
  silent check; if an update is available, a modal pops with a
  link to the GitHub release page in your default browser.
  Subsequent windows in the same session skip the check (mirrors
  the first-window-only gating used by the doc recovery UI).
  Errors and "you're current" outcomes are silent on the
  auto-launch path — no notification noise when you're offline
  or already up to date. The manual Help → Check for Updates…
  and the Settings panel button still give full feedback for
  every outcome.

### Fixed

- **Help → Check for Updates now reports a result.** Every click
  now resolves to one of three dialogs: "You're on the latest
  version" (with the version number), "Update available" (with a
  button to open the release page on GitHub so you can read what's
  in it; the actual download proceeds in the background), or
  "Couldn't check: <reason>" with the Releases URL as a manual
  fallback. The previous silent-no-feedback behavior is gone.
- **About this install panel** (Settings → General) now lists
  Chromium and Electron versions as separate fields, alongside the
  existing app version + OS + user-agent. Makes "is the user
  running the version they think they are?" a one-line check
  during bug triage instead of a UA-parsing exercise.
- **Release workflow no longer races itself.** alpha.2's release
  produced two separate drafts because three OS matrix jobs
  concurrently saw "no release for this tag" and each created its
  own. A new `prepare-release` job runs first to create the draft,
  then the matrix jobs upload to it. No user-facing change; cleaner
  release ergonomics.
- **macOS scrolling, typing, and nav-pane click latency now
  match the in-browser feel.** alpha.2 on macOS was materially
  slower than the web edition on the same machine. Two
  coordinated fixes close that gap: the editor's scroll
  container migrated from the document itself to an inner
  bounded container (`#app`), which eliminated a doc-height
  composited layer Chromium was re-compositing on every scroll;
  and the bundled Electron version was upgraded from 33
  (Chromium 130) to 42 (Chromium 148), which lands the newer
  Skia Graphite compositor backend and the per-event decoupling
  improvements that make Chrome on macOS feel smooth on the
  same content. Linux and Windows builds also benefit but the
  gap was smaller there to begin with.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts cheat sheet now lists every bindable
  action.** The reference modal was hand-maintained and had
  fallen behind the keybindings registry — twenty-plus
  commands added in alpha.2 (zoom, chrome scale, paintbrush
  toggles, find, font color, the four picker openers, the
  three tools menus, and several others) weren't appearing.
  Now drives off the full registry and won't silently drift
  out of sync again.
- **Scrolling past the nav pane's top or bottom no longer
  scrolls the editor.** The wheel-event chain now stops at the
  nav pane's boundary, which also fixes the follow-up bug where
  reversing scroll direction kept scrolling the editor instead
  of the nav pane.
- **Open button on the web edition no longer silently drops your
  selection.** Clicking the 📂 Open button, picking a file, and
  ending up with nothing loaded — while `Ctrl-O` worked on the
  same page — was a race in the file-picker cancellation
  detection. Fixed by switching to the native `cancel` event.
- **Dark mode now guarantees readable text everywhere.** Three
  related fixes that together make dark-mode-with-apply-to-doc
  actually usable on real Verbatim docs:
  - Runs that Word writes with an explicit "default black" color
    (`w:color="000000"`) used to stay literally black, leaving
    large swaths of body text invisible against the dark
    surface. Now they inherit the themed text color and flip
    light.
  - Shading (Verbatim's "protected highlight" — yellow, grey,
    etc.) now forces text contrast like highlights already did:
    black on light shading, white on dark shading, regardless
    of theme.
  - Hyperlinks use a bright sky blue in dark mode (Word's
    `#0563C1` is too dark to read on a dark background).
  - Beyond those: any text color you (or Word) wrote that's
    too dark to read against the dark surface — Word's
    hyperlink blue, deep grays, dark reds — falls back to the
    themed text color. Turn off "Apply theme to the document
    area" if you'd rather see the original colors.
  - Underlines under highlighted / shaded text now match the
    text color (black on light backgrounds, white on dark),
    instead of staying themed-white and cutting through the
    black text like a faded slash.
  - The nav pane flattens to white in dark mode — the
    per-level greys and analytic-blue cues read as
    inconsistent against the dark chrome.
  - "Dark chrome, light document" mode (dark theme with
    "Apply theme to the document area" OFF — the default)
    now actually paints the document area white, across the
    full scrollable extent in both single-doc and multi-pane.
    Previously the editor surface had no background of its
    own and showed the dark chrome's color through it,
    defeating the whole point of leaving "apply to document"
    off.
  - Native form controls in dark mode now render in their
    dark variant. Previously the body-font dropdown in
    Settings → Appearance painted its select with the dark
    background-color token but left the option text in the
    browser's default near-black, making the font names
    invisible against the dark dropdown.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 — 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Built-in countdown timer.** Native replacement for Verbatim's
  bundled timer. Toggle with the ⏱ button in the ribbon. Includes
  a big speech-timer display with start / pause, three speech-
  duration presets, Aff and Neg prep clocks, and a reset column.
  Type into the display while paused to set a custom duration.
  State syncs across windows. Configurable in Settings →
  Appearance: profile (High School / College / Pomodoro) with
  per-profile editable durations, compact layout, low-time flash
  with editable thresholds, and prep-side label style (Both /
  Text / Color).
- **Dark mode** (Settings → Appearance → Theme: Light / Dark /
  System). The document area stays light by default; flip
  "Apply theme to the document area" for full dark.
- **Chrome scale chord** (`Mod-Alt-=` / `Mod-Alt--` /
  `Mod-Alt-0`) scales the whole window the way your browser's
  `Ctrl-+` zoom does. Independent of the editor zoom
  (`Mod-=` / `Mod--`), so you can fine-tune content size on top.
  Keyboard-only — rebind in Settings → Keybindings.
- **Open with CardMirror from your file manager.** `.docx` and
  `.cmir` are registered as CardMirror file types at install
  time. Double-clicking a file in Finder / Explorer / your Linux
  file manager opens it in CardMirror — spawning a new window if
  the app's already running.
- **Find and Replace** (Ctrl-F / Ctrl-H / Alt-F). Floating bar
  with case-sensitive and whole-word toggles, next / prev
  navigation, a match count, Replace, and Replace All. Every
  match highlights in light yellow with the active match in a
  stronger orange. Three result orderings: categorized (Ctrl-F:
  headings → tags → cites → body, with the category priority
  reorderable in Settings → General), proximity-only (Alt-F),
  and the same categorized order in replace mode (Ctrl-H). The
  bar's expandable results panel lists every match at a glance.
  The nav pane decorates outline entries whose subtree contains
  a match. Find can be scoped to a selection.
- **Editable image alt text** — right-click an image →
  Edit alt text… opens a dialog. Alt text now round-trips
  through `.docx` import and export (the importer used to drop
  it). The AI alt-text generator also updates the image's alt
  attribute and asks before regenerating existing alt text.
- **Active doc filename in a ribbon pill** (opt-in, Settings →
  Appearance → "Show doc name in ribbon"). Useful where the OS
  title bar isn't visible — tiling window managers, hidden-title
  themes, embedded web edition.
- **Multi-pane window title shows every open slot**, joined by
  `·` — e.g. "Foo · Bar — CardMirror" — instead of just the
  focused doc's name.
- **Show / hide the nav pane.** Three ways to toggle: the ☰
  button in the ribbon, the × in the nav-pane header, or a small
  pull-tab on the left edge of the viewport (visible only when
  the nav pane is hidden). Per-window state.
- **Right-click on a hyperlink** opens a context menu — Open
  Link, Copy Link Address, Edit Link…, Remove Link.
- **About this install in Settings → General** — version, host,
  OS, and full user-agent for bug reports. On desktop, includes
  Check for updates and Open crash dumps folder buttons.
- **Every ribbon action is now keybindable** in Settings →
  Keybindings. Twelve previously click-only actions joined the
  registry: font-size step up / down, apply font color, open
  settings, toggle paragraph integrity, the four color/size
  picker dropdowns, and the doc / card / table tools menus.
- **Zoom and paintbrush toggles are keybindable.** Defaults:
  Mod-= zoom in, Mod-- zoom out. The reset chord and paintbrush
  toggles ship unbound (assign them yourself if you want).

### Accessibility

- **Reduce motion** (Settings → Accessibility). System (follows
  OS preference) / On / Off. Flattens UI animations.
- **Readability-tuned body fonts.** Three SIL-OFL fonts ship
  with CardMirror: **Atkinson Hyperlegible**, **Lexend**, and
  **OpenDyslexic**. Plus the British Dyslexia Association's
  endorsed system sans-serifs (Verdana, Tahoma, Comic Sans MS)
  when installed on your OS. Settings → Appearance → Body font
  groups options by category with the readability options
  leading.
- **Highlight + shading display overrides** with 1–3 ordered
  slots. Slot 1 remaps the most-common color in the doc, slot 2
  the next-most-common, last slot is a catch-all.
- **Per-token color overrides** for every UI color (background,
  borders, accent, hover, etc.) with reset-per-row + reset-all
  controls. Overrides win over the active theme.
- **Cursor-position color readout** in the status bar — when an
  override is active, shows the actual stored colors at the
  cursor so you know what's encoded in the doc even when the
  override is hiding it.

### Changed

- **Nav-pane heading clicks are dramatically faster on big
  docs.** Clicks where the heading is already visible are nearly
  instant. First click into a fresh part of the doc no longer
  adds a multi-second pause on top of the unavoidable rendering
  cost. (Previously every click cost ~2 seconds on a 2000-card
  file.)
- **Re-pressing a heading shortcut** (F4 / F5 / F6 / F7 /
  Mod-F7 / Mod-F8) on a paragraph that already has that style
  strips the paragraph's indentation while keeping the style.
  Was a no-op before.
- **F8 / Apply Cite Style** now expands to the word at the
  cursor when there's no selection — matching F10's behavior.
- **Shift-F3 (cycle case)** keeps the selection across cycles,
  so you can re-press to advance lower → UPPER → Title → lower.
- **Triple-click + drag** extends the selection paragraph-by-
  paragraph (was: collapsed back to character-level on first
  drag move).
- **Text-selection background is translucent** — highlights,
  shading, and other colored backgrounds show through. You can
  now tell at a glance whether selected text is highlighted.
- **Selected images** show a 2 px accent outline so it's
  obvious the click registered.
- **Paint mode cursor** is an I-beam with a small swatch of the
  active paint color in the corner. Picking a different color
  while paint mode is armed updates the cursor live.
- **Caret stays visible** after Enter / arrow keys / new-
  heading actions. The browser's auto-scroll-into-view now
  respects the fixed ribbon and status bar.
- **Window adapts to any size.** The 800×600 floor is gone, so
  the status bar stays visible on small / tiled / split-screen
  layouts. Ribbon panels hide progressively in a deterministic
  order when the ribbon runs out of room; settings,
  keyboard-shortcut, read-mode, and nav-pane buttons hide last.
- **New setting: default file format for new docs** — `.docx`
  (default) or `.cmir`. Affects the Save-As default for any doc
  that doesn't yet have an on-disk handle.
- **New setting: jump to doc top on read-mode toggle**, off by
  default. When on, toggling read mode scrolls to the top and
  places the cursor at the doc's start.
- **Word-count selection button (Σ)** moved off the ribbon to
  the left edge of the status bar, next to the live read-aloud
  word counter.
- **Speech-doc designation** uses the same warm-gold accent in
  both multi-window mode (the banner under the ribbon) and
  multi-pane mode (the per-pane chip).
- **Ribbon cleanup**: the plain-paste toggle (`T`) is hidden on
  desktop where F2 reads the clipboard directly. The autosave
  toggle is hidden on the web edition where autosave can't fire.
- **Keyboard-shortcut command labels** in Settings →
  Keybindings use consistent title casing throughout.

### Fixed

- **Toggling multi-pane → single-window mode no longer silently
  drops open docs.** Some panes' contents were lost on the
  switch back to one-doc-per-window.
- **Picking up a nav-pane heading and releasing without moving
  drops it back where it came from.** Used to land in a sibling
  slot.
- **Copy Last Cite now finds cite-marked text you just
  applied.** Previously, applying the cite style via marking
  text (rather than a paragraph style change) didn't promote
  the paragraph, so Copy Last Cite fell back to an older cite.
- **Underline / Emphasis font-size settings take effect.** The
  per-style size sliders for these two styles were silently
  ignored before.
- **Files from 2013–14-era Verbatim distributions import with
  underline / cite formatting intact.** Those distributions
  used older character-style ids that CardMirror used to skip
  silently.
- **AI alt-text descriptions reflect what the image is doing in
  the argument.** Generations now include the enclosing card's
  tag and cite, plus the paragraphs immediately before and
  after the image, instead of producing generic captions.
- **"New document" while CardMirror is already running no
  longer offers to recover docs from other windows.** Only the
  first window of an app session surfaces the startup-recovery
  sidebar.
- **Opening a doc starts both the editor and nav pane scrolled
  to the top** instead of inheriting the previous doc's scroll
  position.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — 2026-05-16

First downloadable preview of CardMirror. **This is an alpha.**
Expect bugs, missing features, and occasional breakage. Don't use
it for tournament-day work yet; keep a Verbatim copy of anything
important.

What works:

- Open and save Microsoft Word `.docx` files. Round-trips against
  Verbatim-format docs.
- Native `.cmir` format for lossless save / restore (no Word
  conversion costs, autosave-eligible).
- Verbatim-parity editing model: Pocket / Hat / Block / Tag /
  Analytic / Undertag styles, F-key shortcuts, condense /
  uncondense / case-toggle, emphasis / underline / highlight,
  shrink, send-to-speech, paste-as-plain.
- Multi-doc workspace — pick between a three-pane single-window
  layout or one window per doc.
- Send-to-speech across windows in multi-window mode.
- Per-doc read mode and autosave.
- Crash-recovery journal — unsaved drafts come back on next
  launch.
- Word-style left navigation pane: outline view, multi-select,
  drag-reorder.

Not in this release (planned):

- Full-text and schema-aware search across open docs / the
  evidence library on disk.
- Transclusion (live-linked content from a source doc).
- Cross-window drag-and-drop. (Cross-pane drag within multi-pane
  mode works.)

Operational:

- **Crash dumps** are collected locally to disk only — never
  uploaded anywhere. If CardMirror crashes and you want to send
  a report, open *Help → Open Crash Dumps Folder* and attach
  the minidump to a GitHub issue.
- **Auto-update**: on launch, CardMirror checks GitHub Releases
  for a newer version and downloads it in the background. When
  one's ready, a dialog asks whether to restart now or install
  on next quit. *Help → Check for Updates…* triggers the same
  check on demand.

Platforms:

- **macOS** — `.dmg` for Intel (x64) and Apple Silicon (arm64).
- **Windows** — NSIS installer (`.exe`) for x64.
- **Linux** — `.AppImage` (distribution-agnostic) and `.pacman`
  (Arch-native; install with `sudo pacman -U file.pacman`) for
  x64.

Known gaps:

- Desktop builds are unsigned. First-launch warnings on
  Windows (SmartScreen) and macOS (Gatekeeper) require a
  right-click → Open. See README.
