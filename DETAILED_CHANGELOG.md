# Detailed Changelog

In-depth release notes for CardMirror. Each entry covers the
behavior, rationale, and (where useful) the implementation context
behind a change. For a shorter, jargon-free summary of what's new
in each release, see `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Unreleased

- **Collab M2 (coediting branch): pairing-mailbox session invites +
  baked relay defaults** (`pairing/room-invite.ts` NEW,
  `receive-pill-ui.ts`, `relay-client.ts`, `collab-ui.ts`,
  `collab-hooks.ts`, ribbon registration, desktop `pairing-ipc.ts` +
  `preload.ts` + `electron-host.ts`). An invite is a normal sealed
  pairing message whose item carries `{shareCode, title}` under type
  `room-invite` — the payload rides `sliceJson`, which main passes
  through verbatim, so the desktop pipeline needed only a per-message
  `minReceiverVersion` override (invites declare the first
  invite-aware version; pre-invite clients drop them with the existing
  update-required toast instead of rendering a dead card row). New
  "Invite Starred Partner to Session" ribbon command sends the active
  session's share code to the starred partner/group; the Receive pill
  renders invite rows ("«name» invited you to collaborate on «doc»")
  with a Join button that hands the code to the lazy collab module
  through a new collab-hooks seam (invite rows don't drag/insert; the
  code is consumed on join). Rooms clients also gain a LAST-fallback
  relay endpoint: the desktop main process exposes its baked relay
  base + shared token over a new `host:collab-relay-defaults` IPC, so
  packaged builds can host/join sessions with zero settings setup
  (resolution stays settings → dev env → baked). Deferred: invite
  seed-snapshot prefetch (plan §4.1) lands with M3 session persistence.

- **Collab M2 (coediting branch): comment-thread sync**
  (`collab/collab-comments.ts` NEW, `comments-plugin.ts`,
  `collab-ui.ts`, tests). Field symptom: comment paint synced (the
  `comment_range` mark rides the doc CRDT) but thread content lives in
  plugin state and never left the machine — the partner's comments
  pane stayed empty. Threads now mirror into a `comments` root LoroMap
  on the session doc (same flush timer, same E2E encryption): nested
  per-thread map keyed by comment id, so concurrent replies MERGE
  rather than LWW-clobbering whole threads; edits are LWW per comment;
  root deletion beats a concurrent reply. Outbound, a session plugin
  mirrors the `commentsKey` mutation metas (scoped to the session view
  — other panes can't leak comments into the room); inbound imports
  dispatch a new `sync-load` refresh that, unlike `load`, PRESERVES
  the GC tombstone parking (orphan parking stays local so undo can
  still resurrect; only explicit deletes touch the shared map). Hosts
  seed their existing threads before the first flush; joiners pull the
  map after the session doc lands. Comment ids switch to random
  Word-compatible int32s during sessions — two peers advancing the
  same small-int counter WOULD collide on concurrent new comments.

- **Collab M2 (coediting branch): formatting-fusion heal — provenance-
  tagged shrink sizes + session invariant plugin** (`schema/marks.ts`,
  `ribbon-commands.ts`, `collab/collab-invariants.ts` NEW,
  `collab-ui.ts`, tests). Field root cause (plan §14): Peritext range
  marks cover text concurrently inserted INSIDE their range, so a
  partner's underlined typing inside a shrunk span inherits the small
  `font_size` at merge — on both replicas, with no op recording it —
  and Loro's UndoManager compounds it by re-marking drifted ranges
  across interleaved remote ops (undo also leaves residue by skipping
  remote interior characters). Worse, fused runs are shrink-EXEMPT, so
  regrow could never clear them. Fix: `font_size` gains an `origin`
  attr — `'shrink'` when the protection-aware sizing machinery
  (shrink/regrow cycle, smart shrink) applied it, `null` for anything
  the user chose (size chip, ± nudge, pasted content; the attr is
  deliberately not DOM-serialized, so clipboard round-trips demote to
  manual). A session-only plugin then heals on the Loro binding's
  transactions (remote imports, init replace, undo/redo): within
  changed ranges, strip `font_size` where `origin === 'shrink'` AND
  the run carries underline/emphasis. Both fusion paths copy the
  enclosing mark's attrs verbatim, so provenance travels with every
  fused copy; user-chosen sizes survive all of them (pinned by a
  manual-wins regression test that doubles as the no-heal control).
  Old saved docs parse fine (attr defaults in) but pre-upgrade shrink
  marks are untagged and won't auto-heal.

- **Collab M2 (coediting branch): field-test fixes — differ mark-kill
  patch, stale-instance watchdog, healer escalation, zombie-proof
  shutdown** (`patches/loro-prosemirror+0.4.3.patch` NEW + postinstall,
  `collab-session.ts`, `room-client.ts`, `_rooms-mock.ts`, relay
  Dockerfile/README, tests). Live two-window testing with relay
  kill/restart cycles surfaced four defects:
  1. *Concurrent highlight loss (upstream binding bug, patched).*
     loro-prosemirror's text differ "normalized" mark state by emitting
     blanket `key: null` retains over every unmarked run on every
     transaction — local no-ops that are REAL unmark ops, LWW-killing
     the partner's concurrent highlights (field: per-paragraph
     winner-take-all). Sibling defect unconditionally delete()d null
     node attrs, clobbering concurrent attr sets. Patched (per-run
     diffing; delete only existing keys) via patch-package; regression
     tests P11/P12 pin both. Upstream report TODO.
  2. *Send-success restarts starved the stream.* restart() aborts the
     in-flight handshake, so steady typing killed every reconnect
     before its hello; live push never resumed while the user typed.
     Now a nudge() (skips backoff wait, never touches an in-flight
     attempt), pinned by a deterministic connect-attempt-count test.
     "Synced" now strictly means the stream's hello state — catch-up
     success no longer paints the chip.
  3. *Zombie relay instances after deploy/restart.* Uvicorn's default
     graceful shutdown waits forever for SSE streams: a stopped
     instance lingers unbound, heartbeating its old streams while the
     new instance owns the port — pushes fan out where nobody listens
     ("synced but updates arrive in 5-minute batches"). Server:
     --timeout-graceful-shutdown 5 in both Dockerfiles. Client:
     self-echo watchdog — the server pushes your own update back to
     your stream, so "posted seq N, stream silent past the deadline"
     proves staleness and hard-restarts the stream.
  4. *Pending-deps healer couldn't reach below the cursor.* A frame
     whose causal deps were shed advanced the cursor past the gap, and
     the healing catch-up (fetching after the cursor) found nothing.
     Catch-ups invoked for missing deps now escalate to a full resync
     from seq 0 when the tail is empty. 409 on stream RECONNECT retries
     (our own ghost may briefly inflate the count) instead of
     terminally reporting the room full.

- **Collab M2 (coediting branch): session UI wiring** (`collab-gate.ts`
  NEW, `collab-hooks.ts` NEW, `collab-ui.ts` NEW; `index.ts`,
  `index.html`, `ribbon-commands.ts`, `ribbon-groups.ts`,
  `ribbon-availability.ts`). Four view-less ribbon commands under a new
  "Collaboration" group — Start / Join / Copy Session Share Code /
  End-or-Leave — all unbound, searchable in the command bar, and hidden
  entirely unless the collab gate is open (`VITE_COLLAB=1` at build
  time or a manual localStorage flip; packaged releases stay dormant).
  Everything heavy loads lazily: the editor core touches only two
  loro-free seams (`collab-hooks.ts`) — a transaction tagger in
  `dispatchTransaction` that stamps sync-origin on the Loro binding's
  transactions BEFORE filters run (so read mode and the AI coordinator
  admit remote edits — the M0 contract cashing in), and a plugin source
  consulted by `buildEditorPlugins` that appends the session's binding
  plugins and swaps `history()` for the CRDT undo manager while a
  session is live (undo never reverts a partner's edits). Session flows
  in `collab-ui.ts`: host = share code auto-copied to the clipboard;
  join = paste-code prompt into a fresh unsaved doc populated by the
  binding; a `#collab-chip` status segment shows synced / sending /
  offline-with-queue; end/leave confirms and restores the normal plugin
  stack. Integration test (`collab-ui-flows.test.ts`) drives the real
  flows end-to-end over the mock relay, including read-mode-on remote
  delivery with local typing still locked.

- **Collab M2 (coediting branch): rooms protocol + client sync core**
  (`relay/server.py` rooms endpoints; `src/editor/collab/` NEW —
  `collab-crypto.ts`, `room-client.ts`, `collab-session.ts`;
  `loro-crdt` 1.13.6 + `loro-prosemirror` 0.4.3 exact-pinned;
  `tests/collab/` NEW, 30 tests). Not user-facing yet — no UI is wired;
  everything is dormant modules + tests.
  - *Server*: durable rooms on the self-hosted relay — create,
    append-update (server-assigned delivery cursor `seq`), cursor-paged
    fetch with snapshot fast-path, client-uploaded encrypted snapshot
    compaction (server truncates the log it cannot read), SSE stream
    (hello{lastSeq} / update / presence / end frames), ephemeral
    presence fan-out (zero-DB hot path), tombstoned deletion (410 ≠
    404), 10-stream participant cap at connect, ≥7-day idle GC. Sync
    handlers per the overload-hardening pattern; fan-out scheduled onto
    the loop with call_soon_threadsafe.
  - *Client*: AES-256-GCM room crypto (WebCrypto; 12-byte IV ‖ ct+tag;
    `cmshare1.<roomId>.<key>` share codes); renderer-portable rooms REST
    client + SSE `RoomStream` (getReader-based sibling of the desktop
    `relay-stream.ts`, same backoff+jitter discipline, 410→ended,
    409→full); `CollabSession` conducting LoroDoc ↔ transport — outbound
    debounce-flush via version-vector diff export, synchronous
    export-before-import so remote ops are never echoed, offline send
    queue with retry, hello-triggered + periodic catch-up (heals shed
    push frames via Loro's causal-dependency queue), host-side snapshot
    compaction cadence, seed state as the room's first regular update.
  - *Tests*: crypto round-trip/tamper (6), transport incl. 10-cap and
    outage reconnect (6), end-to-end two-editor sessions over the
    in-process mock relay — seed propagation, live convergence, the
    travel-day offline/reconnect cycle, the P1 highlight-union
    regression through the full encrypted stack, session end (5) — plus
    the promoted bake-off suites: Peritext criteria + structural merges
    with leader-gated repair (12; concurrent-creation boundary
    insertion documented as peer-id tie-broken, asserted for
    convergence not inclusion) and a 15-seed 3-peer CRDT fuzz (1).

- **Collab groundwork (M0): sync-origin meta contract, normalizer loop
  guard, deterministic doc repair** (`sync-origin.ts` NEW,
  `normalizer-guard.ts` NEW, `doc-repair.ts` NEW; `read-mode-plugin.ts`,
  `ai/edit-coordinator.ts`, `absorb-plugin.ts`,
  `cite-classifier-plugin.ts`, `named-style-normalizer-plugin.ts`,
  `import/index.ts`). Three standalone-valuable pieces of the
  collaborative-editing groundwork:
  1. *Sync-origin transactions.* `markSyncOrigin(tr)` tags a transaction
     as already-merged remote content. Read mode's `filterTransaction`
     and the AI edit coordinator now admit such transactions
     unconditionally — rejecting one would desynchronize the editor from
     a shared document. The coordinator instead *releases* any lease a
     sync edit touches (checked against pre-mapping positions); the
     owning AI feature already treats a vanished lease as abort-and-retry.
  2. *Normalizer round guard.* ProseMirror re-runs `appendTransaction`
     with no bound, so two normalizers that each "fix" the other's output
     could wedge the renderer in an infinite dispatch loop (a
     WHITE_SCREEN_AUDIT wedge contributor). All three normalizers now
     route appended transactions through `guardNormalizerTr`, which
     stamps origin + round metas and drops the pass (with a console
     warning) past round 8. Normalizer output is admitted in read mode —
     it only fires in response to transactions the lock already admitted.
  3. *Deterministic doc repair.* `repairDoc`/`buildDocRepairTr`: pads
     ragged tables (prosemirror-tables `fixTables`), sweeps co-present
     `excludes` marks (keeps the earlier-declared), and restores the
     card/analytic_unit first-child invariant. Pure and idempotent by
     construction. Wired into `fromDocx`/`fromDocxFull` so Word's
     tolerated-ragged tables arrive rectangular.
  Tests: `sync-origin.test.ts` (7), `normalizer-guard.test.ts` (5),
  `doc-repair.test.ts` (4), and `collab-fuzz.test.ts` — a seeded fuzz
  skeleton (25 seeds × 25 random ops against the real schema with the
  normalizer trio active) asserting validity, no cap trips, and repair
  idempotence; the CRDT bindings slot into this harness later.

- **Relay test harnesses preserved in-repo** (`dev/relay-contract.mjs`
  NEW, `dev/relay-load.mjs` NEW). The 20-check wire-contract suite (the
  old-client compatibility gate for any relay change) and the SSE/POST
  load client used for the capacity study and the hardening acceptance
  runs, previously session-local scripts.

- **Relay hardening: blocking DB work moved off the event loop**
  (`relay/server.py`, `relay/Dockerfile`). Load-testing found the
  single-worker relay wedged permanently at ~200 POST/s: the async
  POST handler ran synchronous SQLAlchemy commits on the asyncio event
  loop, and under burst the loop + threadpool-dependency convoy stopped
  reading new connections entirely (CPU idle, DB pool idle, established
  SSE streams unaffected — but new requests dead until restart).
  `POST /relay/messages` is now a sync `def` handler (Starlette runs it
  in the threadpool, like GET/DELETE already were), with the request
  body read on the loop via a small async dependency. Because
  asyncio.Queues are loop-owned and not thread-safe, the store-then-push
  fan-out is scheduled onto the loop with `call_soon_threadsafe` instead
  of being touched from the worker thread. The connection pool is sized
  to the threadpool (40/0, `pool_timeout=5`) and pool exhaustion maps to
  a clean 503; the Dockerfile adds `--limit-concurrency 4096` as a
  connection-storm backstop (it counts long-lived SSE streams, so it
  must stay far above the expected stream population). Measured: the
  ~200 msg/s permanent-wedge cliff is gone — ~590 msg/s sustained on
  the test box with stable latencies (ack p95 ≤51 ms), delivery p95
  90 ms → 25 ms at 100 msg/s, zero lost pushes across an 18,443-message
  ramp, and the 20-check wire-contract suite passes identically before
  and after (old clients unaffected by construction).

## 0.1.0-beta.7 — 2026-07-02

- **Card sharing v2 transport: SSE push + self-hosted relays**
  (`relay-stream.ts` NEW, `pairing-ipc.ts`, `preload.ts`,
  `electron-host.ts`, `pairing-wiring.ts`, `settings.ts`,
  `dev/mock-relay/server.js`; server counterpart in the
  scouting-assistant repo).
  Replaces the 30-second receive poller with push delivery.
  `RelayStream` (new module, zero deps — streamed undici fetch + hand
  parser) subscribes to the relay's `GET /relay/stream?recipient=` SSE
  channel: `event: hello` on connect, one `data:` frame per POSTed
  bundle in the same wire shape as `GET /messages`, `: hb` heartbeat
  comments every 25s. Reconnects forever with exponential backoff +
  jitter; 404 → the relay predates push, so the session falls back to
  today's interval polling (capability detection — old servers and old
  clients both keep working; the server keeps `GET /messages`
  unchanged); 401 → surfaced distinctly and retried at max backoff.
  `pairing-ipc` gains a delivery manager: catch-up `pollOnce()` on
  every (re)connect and on `powerMonitor` resume (dead-socket
  restart), `pollSeconds` repurposed as the legacy-fallback cadence
  and (floored to 5 min) the belt-and-suspenders catch-up while
  streaming; delivery is at-least-once with the existing
  `consumed`/`rx-<msgId>` dedupe absorbing push/catch-up overlap. The
  decrypt→inbox path is untouched (extracted to `processMessages`,
  shared by both paths). The renderer re-configures on every settings
  change, so the configure handler now only restarts delivery when a
  delivery-relevant field changed — a display-name edit must not sever
  the stream. New settings `pairingRelayUrl`/`pairingRelayToken`
  (Card Sharing tab) point at a self-hosted relay; URL/token
  resolution is settings → env → baked default, with all requests
  routing Authorization through one supplier function. The dev mock
  relay grows a matching `/stream` (and `PAIRING_NO_STREAM=1` to
  simulate a legacy relay). Server side (scouting-assistant): SSE
  endpoint with per-connection asyncio queues + single-worker
  registry, store-then-push on POST, the per-GET full-table sweep
  replaced by a `created_at` cutoff filter (sweeper thread still owns
  deletion), and a composite `(recipient_code, created_at)` index.
  A standalone, self-hostable relay implementing the identical wire
  contract ships in the new `relay/` folder (single-file FastAPI +
  Postgres, Dockerfile + docker-compose, README) — the scouting
  backend is not public, so self-hosters get the server from here.
  Verified: 5 RelayStream tests against a live local HTTP server
  (`tests/desktop/relay-stream.test.ts`), a 13-check contract suite
  against the real backend on local Postgres (push, catch-up, ack,
  auth, expiry semantics), and the same 13 checks against the
  standalone `relay/` server.

- **Standardize with exceptions** (`ribbon-commands.ts`, `ribbon-groups.ts`,
  `settings.ts`, `settings-ui.ts`, `index.ts`).
  Two new commands, `standardizeHighlightExcept` and
  `standardizeShadingExcept`, mirror the plain standardize pair — same
  auto-scoping (selection when non-empty, whole doc otherwise), same
  rewrite-to-active-pen semantics, same null-pen strip — but skip any run
  whose *current* color matches a configured exception, leaving it
  completely untouched (including under a null pen, which makes the
  commands double as "strip everything except my exception color").
  Implementation is a single optional `except` getter threaded through
  `runUniColor` → `uniHighlight` / `uniShade`; the run's mark color is
  compared against the exception before the remove/add — highlight by
  exact Word name, shading case-insensitively via the existing `upperHex`
  normalization (stored shading attrs from imports can be lowercase).
  Two new settings back the commands: `standardizeHighlightException`
  (one of Word's 15 highlight names; sanitized through
  `isWordHighlightName`, default `yellow`) and
  `standardizeShadingException` (bare 6-char hex, uppercased on write via
  `isHex6`, default `FFFF00` — yellow, matching the highlight default).
  They render in a new Editing-tab section,
  "Standardize exceptions": the highlight editor is a name-storing swatch
  row of the 15 Word colors plus a label naming the pick (highlights can
  only be those 15); the shading editor reuses the free-color-editor shape
  (picker + swatches, storing bare hex) with a Protected Grey swatch
  appended after the shading palette. Doc menu → Highlighting gains both
  entries below the plain pair; since the menu rebuilds on every open, the
  labels interpolate the live exception ("Standardize Highlighting (except
  Bright Green)"). Both commands are registered keybindable (unbound by
  default, "Highlight tools" group) with find-palette aliases. New test
  file `tests/editor/standardize-except.test.ts` (7 tests): rewrite-with-
  skip, null-pen + exception, plain-standardize regression, selection
  scoping, and case-insensitive shading matching.

- **Search palette: truncation tooltips** (`quick-card-search-ui.ts`).
  Every result row's name span and meta span (the file's directory) are
  ellipsis-truncated by CSS with no way to see the full text. Rows now
  get a `mouseenter` handler that compares `scrollWidth` to `clientWidth`
  and sets the native `title` to the full text only when the ellipsis
  actually cut something off (clearing it otherwise). The check runs
  lazily on hover rather than at render time because layout isn't final
  while rows are being built, and this way it stays correct across
  palette resizes; it also costs nothing for keyboard-only use. Covers
  all result sources — file rows, in-file object rows (headings / tags /
  cites), and outline browse rows all render through the same spans.

- **Create Reference customization** (`create-reference.ts`, `settings.ts`,
  `settings-ui.ts`, `index.ts`).
  User-requested: control over what Create Reference puts on the
  clipboard. `createReference` now takes a `CreateReferenceOptions`
  object instead of the lone `useGray50` boolean, and the transform is
  extracted into `buildReferenceNodes` — a pure node builder (no DOM, no
  clipboard) so every option combination is directly testable. Seven new
  settings in a new Editing-tab "Create Reference" section (the existing
  `forReferenceUseGray50` toggle moved in, relabeled "Use Gray-50% body
  text" since the section supplies the context):
  `createReferenceIncludeHeading` (default on — off drops the
  `<<CITE FOR REFERENCE>>` heading paragraph); three heading-shape
  settings `dependsOn`-greyed while the heading is off —
  `createReferenceDelimiter` (the six "Condense with warning" mirror
  pairs, default `<<`; heading assembly lives in the exported pure
  helper `referenceHeadingText`), `createReferenceIncludeCite`
  (default on), and `createReferenceCustomHeading` (free label
  replacing FOR REFERENCE; a case-insensitive `%Cite%` token marks
  where the cite goes, no token = cite prepended as in the default;
  whitespace left by an emptied token is collapsed, and a label that
  ends up empty falls back to FOR REFERENCE rather than emitting bare
  brackets); `createReferenceShrinks` (default on) with
  `createReferenceShrinkPt` (default 3, sanitizer-clamped 1–20,
  `dependsOn`-greyed while shrinking is off; with shrinking off, runs
  keep their existing `font_size` marks untouched rather than being
  restamped); and `createReferenceHighlightMode`
  (`'shading'` default = the old highlight → grey C0C0C0 conversion;
  `'convert'` = a background in the highlight's own color via
  `highlightRgbFor`, matching the Highlight to Background command;
  `'keep'` leaves highlight marks in place; `'remove'` strips them
  without adding shading). Body coloring and the 1pt floor are
  unchanged. Per maintainer direction, user-facing text says "grey",
  not "Protected Grey", where no disambiguation from the other grey
  swatches is needed. New test file
  `tests/editor/create-reference-options.test.ts` (16 tests) covering
  the default composition, each option axis, cite collection, the
  heading-assembly rules, and the empty-selection guard.

- **Hover fixes** (`style.css`). Recover Drafts: `…-row-btn-save` had
  no hover rule and `…-row-btn-open:hover` filled with
  `--pmd-c-accent-hover` under themed text (illegible dark-on-dark);
  both now share `--pmd-c-hover` + accent border-color. Receive pill:
  `.pmd-receive-bar:hover` joined the shared hover-scaffolding group
  (dropzone-bar family). Send pill deliberately untouched — its
  drag-over "hot" state is its affordance. Settings: the Receive-pill
  flash row moved above the fallback-poll row in the Card Sharing tab.

- **Custom acronym letters + Underline Acronym**
  (`acronym-patterns.ts` NEW, `ribbon-commands.ts`, `ribbon-groups.ts`,
  `settings.ts`, `settings-ui.ts`, `style.css`).
  Feature request modeled on the acronym customization in
  [shreerammodi/debate-scripts](https://github.com/shreerammodi/debate-scripts)
  (GPLv3 — reimplemented from scratch, no code ported): the acronym
  commands consult a user table before the
  classic first-letter-per-word behavior. Where his VBA uses a
  hardcoded phrase → "wordIdx:charSpec" DSL table, ours stores
  `acronymPatterns: Array<{phrase, chars}>` — raw character offsets
  picked by CLICKING letters in a settings letter-picker (new
  "Acronym marking" section, Editing tab). Direct manipulation
  deliberately replaces the DSL: positions come from clicks, so
  nothing can be mistyped, no validation UI is needed, and the marked
  cells double as the live preview. Phrase edits keep a pick only
  where the character at that offset is unchanged. Command side: the
  duplicated first-letter walks in `emphasizeAcronym` /
  `highlightAcronym` are extracted into a shared
  `acronymTargetRanges(state, skipBlocks)` which also builds the
  expanded-selection text (inline leaves as `\0`); when the selection
  lives in ONE textblock and its whole-word-expanded text equals a
  phrase case-insensitively (exact spacing/punctuation — offsets then
  map 1:1), the picked offsets are marked instead of first letters.
  Multi-paragraph selections and non-matches keep classic behavior;
  per-command semantics unchanged (emphasis strip rules, highlight
  null-pen strip, structural-block skip differences). New
  `underlineAcronym` command (unbound, Character styles group)
  completes the trio, mirroring `emphasizeAcronym` with
  `underline_mark`. Table ships empty by design. 10 tests in
  `tests/editor/acronym-patterns.test.ts`: matching/sanitizing, all
  three commands, partial-selection expansion, null pen,
  multi-paragraph fallback.

- **Background-color cue: faint dot grid** (`settings.ts`, `index.ts`,
  `marks.ts`, `style.css`).
  New Appearance toggle `distinguishShading` (default off) rendering a
  subtle visual distinction between `shading` and `highlight` marks,
  which are otherwise deliberately identical: a faint 4px
  radial-gradient dot grid over each shaded run. Resolved into
  `data-shading-cue="dots"` on the document root (the attribute-swap
  pattern); style.css gates the treatment on
  `.ProseMirror [data-shading-band]` spans. The dot color is
  `color-mix`ed from the span's own fill toward the existing
  `--pmd-c-band-fg-*` tokens, reusing the shading luminance-band
  machinery — light fills get slightly darker dots (89/11), dark
  fills flip toward white (80/20) so navy and black fills stay
  legible. To expose the fill to CSS, the shading `toDOM` now also
  emits `--sh: #hex` alongside the literal `background-color` (kept
  for clipboard consumers; `parseDOM` reads `data-shading`, so
  round-trip is unaffected — verified by the existing mark-fidelity
  suite). Dot-grid phase resets at span boundaries within a run;
  accepted over `background-attachment: fixed`, which costs scroll
  repaints on large docs. A 1px top "plate edge" variant was
  prototyped against a live mockup and cut: boxed emphasis draws 1px
  borders around runs, so a hairline reads as a stray box fragment.

- **Fix: table cell borders vanished after any keybinding change**
  (`table-plugins.ts` NEW, `index.ts`, `style.css`). The reported
  main-editor case: prosemirror-tables' `columnResizing()` registers
  its table nodeView — the one that wraps tables in `.tableWrapper`,
  which ALL table CSS hangs off — by mutating its own plugin spec
  inside `state.init`. The app reconfigures the editor with a fresh
  `buildEditorPlugins()` on every `ribbonKeyOverrides` /
  `keyboardMacros` change, and `reconfigure` skips `init` for
  plugins whose key already exists — so the fresh instance's
  `nodeViews` map stayed empty, the view rebuilt node views from it,
  and every table re-rendered unwrapped: no cell borders, no
  column-resize handles, stable until reload. Fix: `tableEditing()` /
  `columnResizing()` are now module-level singletons
  (`table-plugins.ts`) reused by every `buildEditorPlugins()` call —
  the nodeView registered by the first `init` rides along through
  every reconfigure. Verified by
  `tests/editor/table-wrapper.test.ts` (2 jsdom tests): one
  reproduces the upstream trap with fresh instances (if it ever
  fails, prosemirror-tables fixed the side effect and the singleton
  can be revisited), one proves the singletons keep the wrapper
  across repeated reconfigures. An initial zoom/border-collapse
  hypothesis was disproven by an Electron pixel-capture harness
  (collapsed borders paint correctly at 12 zoom levels × DPR
  1/1.25/1.5/2 on this Chromium), so the interim
  `border-collapse: separate` change was reverted. Second, smaller
  fix kept: the table rules were scoped to
  `:is(#editor, .pmd-pane-editor) .tableWrapper`, so the Quick Cards
  manage editor (`.pmd-qc-manage-editor` host) rendered tables with
  no borders at all; rescoped to `.ProseMirror .tableWrapper`.
  Border DATA was never involved — OOXML borders ride opaquely in
  `rawTblPr`/`rawTcPr`; the editor paints its own uniform 1px grid.
  Note: read mode hiding tables entirely is by design.

- **Fix: condense-on-paste scoped to the cursor, not the paste**
  (`paste-plugin.ts`).
  With `condenseOnPaste` on, both F2 paths (Electron's
  `applyPlainPasteFromText` and the browser armed-mode `handlePaste`)
  dispatched the paste and then ran `condenseBranchC` /
  `condenseMerge` against the post-paste collapsed cursor.
  `resolveCondenseScope` treats an empty selection as "the enclosing
  card, else nothing" — so the common case, pasting a plain-text blob
  at doc level, condensed nothing (all intraparagraph whitespace
  survived), and a mid-card paste over-condensed the whole card. Both
  sites now share `condensePastedRange`: capture the selection start
  before the paste, take the post-paste cursor as the end, select
  that range, run the settings-driven condense (the same pattern
  `pasteTextAndCondense` already used), and collapse the cursor back
  to the end of the range. A whole paragraph the paste merges into is
  cleaned in full — identical to F3 over a selection touching it. New
  `tests/editor/condense-on-paste.test.ts` (5 tests): the doc-level
  repro, out-of-range content untouched, merge branch, cursor
  restoration, and setting-off passthrough.

- **Comment-audit follow-ups** (`settings.ts`, `settings-ui.ts`,
  `word-break.ts`, `word-selection-keymap.ts`, `word-selection-plugin.ts`,
  `find-replace-plugin.ts`, `ribbon-commands.ts`).
  Removed two dead symbols the audit's reviewers surfaced —
  `sanitizeHexColor` (superseded by the slots-array sanitizer) and
  `COMMON_FONTS` (only reference was its own definition; `FONT_GROUPS`
  itself stays live). Removed all six references to the
  never-vendored spec doc `word-selection-behavior.md` (two of which
  embedded a machine-local `~/Downloads` path): `word-break.ts`'s
  header is now the canonical definition of the word-selection model
  and its Layer 1/2/3 taxonomy, and the other five sites point there.

- **Code comment audit** (140 files across `src/`, `apps/desktop/src/`,
  `tests/`, `scripts/`, `dev/`; comments only — no user-facing impact).
  A 52-agent audit rationalized the comments accumulated across AI
  sessions: 554 rewritten, 38 deleted (net −475 lines). Removed
  change-narration documenting transitions whose earlier state no longer
  exists, conversation echoes ("per user…", dated session markers),
  stranded/misattached JSDoc, and restating-the-code noise; enforced
  consistent formatting and terminology (code identifiers in backticks,
  user-facing features by their UI names). Unverifiable-but-plausible
  claims (perf measurements, platform anecdotes, Word/Verbatim domain
  knowledge) were kept deliberately. Verified three ways: every changed
  file minifies byte-identically to its pre-audit version (esbuild,
  comments stripped), an adversarial reviewer pass per shard restored
  over-trimmed load-bearing info (7 restorations, 17 drift fixes), and
  typecheck + the full suite stay green. Excluded: `card-cutter-*`
  files, generated `icons.css`, CI-owned `pairing-build.ts`.

- **Terminology: "shading" → "background color" in user-facing text**
  (`settings.ts`, `MANUAL.md`).
  Per maintainer direction, user-facing text uses Word's name for the
  feature. Accessibility settings renamed: "Override shading color in
  display" → "Override background color in display", "Shading override
  colors" → "Background override colors", "Show highlight & shading
  names…" → "Show highlight & background color names…" (labels and
  descriptions only — setting keys, the `shading` mark, and the `Sh:`
  status-bar abbreviation are unchanged; `aliases` with the old wording
  keep palette search working). Two override descriptions were also
  shortened per maintainer wording. MANUAL swept with the convention:
  first use reads "background color (or shading)", every later use just
  "background color". The ribbon and command labels already said
  "Background color", so this closes the gap rather than opening one.
  Released changelog sections keep their historical wording.

## 0.1.0-beta.6 — 2026-07-02

- **Settings navigability: section headers, Files tab, category moves**
  (`settings.ts`, `settings-categories.ts`, `settings-ui.ts`, `style.css`,
  `MANUAL.md`).
  The General / Appearance / Editing tabs had become walls of 20+ rows.
  Two structural changes, per maintainer direction (a third layer — a
  filter box — was proposed and declined): (1) `SettingMeta` gains an
  optional presentational `section` field; the dialog's render loop emits
  an `<h3 class="pmd-settings-section-title">` whenever `section` changes
  between consecutive entries of a tab, so entries sharing a section must
  stay contiguous in SETTING_METADATA (documented on the field). No
  per-tab config table — the manifest stays the single source of truth.
  (2) A new `files` category (tab between General and Appearance)
  collects the 18 file-flow settings that dominated General: new-document
  defaults (onboarding doc, speech-doc folder/format, save format, Pocket
  seed), the Send/Read/Marked preset family (prefix toggle + three
  prefixes + two destination/folder pairs), and the five file-search
  settings. General keeps Workspace / Editor behavior / Word counts /
  Find / Timer / Integrations; Appearance gets Theme & chrome / Document
  typography / Formatting panel / Nav pane & indicators / Timer display;
  Editing gets Typing / Condense / Formatting operations / Insert
  surfaces / Translation. MANUAL's settings-reference chapter rewritten
  to mirror the tab + section order (bold lines = in-app section
  headers). While restructuring, three pre-existing MANUAL drifts were
  fixed: "Show dropzone shelf" was listed under Appearance but has been
  an Editing setting; a "Skip mid-text confirm when inserting quick
  cards" bullet documented a setting that doesn't exist (the mid-text
  guard is a plain `window.confirm` with no toggle) and was dropped; and
  three undocumented settings gained bullets (Layout on this device,
  Keep a Verbatim Flow connection warm, Paragraph spacing), with the
  platform-marker note extended to *(web)* / *(Windows)*. In the same
  push, several settings changed category per maintainer direction: the
  four voice entries (microphone, auto-sleep, dash style, dictation
  model) moved from the top to the bottom of Accessibility; Timer
  profile + Timer durations moved Appearance → General (now the Timer
  section — the other three timer settings, prep label style / compact
  layout / low-time flash, stay in Appearance under Timer display); Cite
  preview on hover + Flashcards-due dot moved General → Appearance (Nav
  pane & indicators), and the one "Settings → General → Flashcards-due
  dot" path reference was updated. Header styling matches the existing
  "About this install" heading; all settings dividers — between rows and
  between sections — share the faint token, with a `:has()` rule
  dropping a row's own divider when it sits against a section boundary
  so lines never stack.

- **Footnote / endnote support** (`schema/nodes.ts` + NEW
  `schema/footnotes.ts`, NEW `import/footnotes.ts`, `importer.ts`,
  `import/index.ts`, `exporter.ts`, `export/index.ts`, NEW
  `editor/footnote-popover.ts`, `style.css`, `MANUAL.md`). Previously
  an open→save cycle destroyed footnotes entirely (references dropped
  by the importer, footnotes.xml never read or written) — a standing
  §3 round-trip violation. Design: a self-contained inline atom
  `footnote` node (the image pattern), attrs { kind:
  footnote|endnote, content: paragraphs of simplified runs {text,
  bold?, italic?, underline?, link?} } — deliberately NOT
  ProseMirror's nested-content footnote (inner EditorView, undo
  handoff): debate footnotes are read-only source citations.
  Import: importNotes() parses footnotes/endnotes.xml (separator
  furniture skipped, the footnoteRef+spacer opening of each body
  stripped, hyperlink targets resolved through the part's own rels);
  references import as empty-bodied markers when the part is absent.
  Export: fresh 1-based ids per part; reference runs use direct
  superscript (no style dependency); parts carry the mandatory
  separator/continuationSeparator entries (Word repair-prompts
  without them); note hyperlinks emit a footnotes.xml.rels with
  escaped targets; content-type overrides + document.xml.rels
  entries only when notes exist. Display: an empty <sup> whose
  number is a pure CSS counter in document order (footnotes 1,2,3…,
  endnotes i,ii,iii… independently — zero JS bookkeeping); click
  opens a popover (title, rendered runs with working links, Edit →
  plain-text textarea → setNodeMarkup; single instance, Escape/
  outside-click dismiss). .cmir support is free (node lives in the
  doc JSON). 7 tests in tests/round-trip/footnotes.test.ts including
  a full toDocx→fromDocx inverse; package structure verified at the
  byte level (well-formed XML, separators, content types, rels).
  Creation: an `insertFootnote` registry command (unbound by default,
  keyboard-only per maintainer — deliberately no Format-menu entry)
  replaces the selection with an empty footnote node and opens the
  popover straight into edit mode (exported `openFootnoteEditor`), so
  the flow is invoke → type → Save. Deletion: a Delete button in the
  popover removes the marker node (error-colored; Backspace over the
  atom in the document works too — the button is the discoverable
  route).

- **Custom dash: configurable trigger** (`settings.ts`,
  `custom-dash-plugin.ts`, `settings-ui.ts`, `MANUAL.md`). New
  `customDashTrigger` ('---' default | '--'). The plugin's original
  header ruled out a `--` rule because it "could never tell a
  forthcoming --- apart" — as an explicit user choice that ambiguity
  dissolves (picking '--' IS the answer). The conversion fires on the
  trigger's last hyphen; in '--' mode the rule refuses to fire
  mid-hyphen-run (a preceding third hyphen — pasted runs, ASCII art —
  blocks it) so only a clean pair converts. Backspace-revert restores
  the configured trigger. The settings row reads "Replace [---|--]
  with [dash style]", both dropdowns gated on the enable checkbox.
  5 new tests (12 total in custom-dash.test.ts).

- **"New paragraph on Enter" settings** (`enter-style.ts` NEW,
  `settings.ts`, `settings-ui.ts`, `index.ts`, `MANUAL.md`). Six
  `enterAfter{Pocket,Hat,Block,Tag,Analytic,Undertag}` settings
  (shared `EnterAfterStyle` union: normal | pocket | hat | block |
  tag | analytic | undertag; all default 'normal' = zero behavior
  change), rendered as ONE settings row — a single shared description
  with six labeled dropdowns on the display-sizes 2-column grid (per
  maintainer: six near-identical descriptions were noise) — in a new
  Editing → "New paragraph on Enter" section. The load-bearing design decision: a non-normal
  choice is DEFINED as "Enter, then that style's command" — the
  handler (`enterWithConfiguredStyle`, bound first in the Enter chain)
  delegates the split to the existing pipeline (tag-keymap overrides,
  then baseKeymap's Enter) and then dispatches the exported
  setHeading/setTag/setAnalytic/setUndertag on the fresh block, so all
  structural edge semantics (card splits, doc-level escapes,
  analytic_unit wrapping) inherit those commands' tested behavior
  instead of duplicating it. Notable inherited consequence, asserted
  in tests: Enter at end of a tag inserts the new body line directly
  under the tag, so Tag → Tag yields a new card that takes over the
  rest of the original card's children, and Tag → Pocket is the
  mid-body split (tag-only card, empty pocket, loose body). 'normal'
  returns false so the untouched pipeline (including user macro /
  ribbon Enter bindings) proceeds exactly as before. The split +
  conversion are two transactions but prosemirror-history groups them
  — one Ctrl-Z reverts both (asserted). 8 tests in
  tests/editor/enter-style.test.ts.

- **Card sharing: reorderable recipients & groups** (`settings-ui.ts`,
  `MANUAL.md`). The send pill renders groups then recipients in raw
  `pairingGroups` / `pairingPartners` array order, but the editors were
  append-only. Each row now carries the Find-category-order up/down
  arrow pair (shared `makePairingReorderButtons`, same button class,
  disabled at the ends) that swaps entries in the settings array itself
  — no new setting, no pill changes (it already rebuilds on settings
  changes), order persists like any settings edit. Groups and
  recipients reorder within their own sections, matching the pill's
  two-section layout. Maintainer decision: the Send to Starred shortcut
  keeps its strict no-op when nothing is starred — sending a card is
  too impactful for a silent fallback to "top of list" — so ordering
  affects the pill only; the star remains the sole shortcut target.

- **Optional undo/redo ribbon stack** (`index.html`, `index.ts`,
  `settings.ts`, `style.css`, `icons.ts`, `scripts/gen-icons.mjs`,
  `icons.css` regenerated, `MANUAL.md`). New `showUndoRedoButtons`
  toggle (Appearance → Theme & chrome, off by default) reveals a
  2-row `.ribbon-button-stack` as `.ribbon-left`'s first child —
  right of the timer panel when that's on the left, left of the file
  buttons. Visibility follows the quick-cards pattern
  (`html.pmd-undoredo-hidden` class in `applyPillVisibility`).
  Buttons run prosemirror-history undo/redo on the focused pane's
  view, swallowing mousedown so the editor keeps selection and focus.
  Two new icons (`undo`/`redo` → Untitled UI `reverse-left/right`,
  classic glyphs ↶/↷): the gitignored icon-source clone was restored
  from github.com/untitleduico/icons, verified byte-identical regen
  against the committed icons.css before adding the MAP entries, then
  regenerated (+6 lines, additive).

- **Timer position setting** (`settings.ts`, `settings-ui.ts`,
  `index.ts`, `style.css`, `MANUAL.md`). New `timerPosition`
  ('left' | 'right', default left) at the top of Appearance's Timer
  display section, rendered as a two-button segmented control (the
  prep-label pattern). Applied as an `html.pmd-timer-right` class →
  one CSS rule gives `#timer-panel` flex `order: 99`, which lands it
  past the right stack at the true edge because `.ribbon-center`'s
  flex-grow absorbs the slack; the panel's separator margin/border
  flips from its right side to its left. No DOM surgery and no
  timer-ui changes — the panel stays the ribbon's first child.

- **Timer transport as bindable commands** (`ribbon-commands.ts`,
  `ribbon-groups.ts`, `MANUAL.md`). Eight new RibbonCommandIds —
  `timerToggleVisible`, `timerStartPause`, `timerPreset1/2/3`,
  `timerStartAffPrep`, `timerStartNegPrep`, `timerReset` — all
  defaulting to no binding (the existing `''` convention), grouped
  under a new "Timer" section in the Keyboard tab (`cycleTimerPreset`
  moved there from View). Each wraps the corresponding
  `timer-state.ts` action behind a shared `timerCommand()` gate: when
  the timer panel is hidden the command returns false so the key falls
  through to other handlers. `timerToggleVisible` is the one exception
  — not gated (its point is bringing the panel up); there was
  previously no registry command for panel visibility at all (the
  ribbon button calls `setTimerVisible` directly). Presets are the one-keystroke version of "click the 9/6/3
  button, then Start" (`loadSpeechPreset` + `startTimer`; a
  missing/zero preset is a no-op), and the prep commands select the
  side's clock and start it. Timer state is BroadcastChannel-synced,
  so keys drive every window like the buttons do. No timer-ui changes;
  timer-state imports nothing, so the new ribbon-commands dependency
  adds no cycle. Also fixed a stale MANUAL path (timer profile /
  durations are under Settings → General since the settings
  reorganization, not Appearance).

- **"No color" is a paintable pen for highlight & shading**
  (`settings.ts`, `ribbon-commands.ts`, `color-panel.ts`, `MANUAL.md`).
  Font color's "Automatic" already worked this way (null persists in
  `lastFontColor`, paint strips); highlight/shading's none swatch was a
  one-shot selection strip that never became the pen.
  `lastHighlightColor` / `lastShadingColor` are now `string | null`
  (null = no-color pen; sanitizers preserve explicit null; defaults
  unchanged). Pen consumers updated: `applyHighlight` / `applyShading`
  (F11 / Mod-F11 / main button / paintbrush) with a null pen always
  strip — the color toggle branch is untouched; `highlightAcronym`
  strips the first-letter ranges; `uniHighlight` / `uniShade`
  ("standardize onto none") strip every marked run in scope, leaving
  unmarked text untouched. The picker's none swatch now persists the
  pick AND strips the selection (the same persist-and-apply shape as
  colored swatches — its strip keeps the trailing-space trim via the
  existing helper, which `setHighlightColor` deliberately doesn't do).
  Indicator bars and the paint-cursor swatch render the null pen as
  plain white (maintainer call: no strikethrough). Untouched by
  design: `setHighlightColor`/`setShadingColor` stay string-only (their
  only null-adjacent caller is the picker, and voice's `applyPen`
  guards on `pen.color`); the card-cutter port already null-safes with
  `|| 'yellow'` (no changes near the live experiment); the status-bar
  Hl:/Sh: names read marks at the cursor, not the pen. Two null-pen
  regression tests added to ribbon-commands.test.ts.

- **Accessibility: nav-pane analytic italics toggle** (`settings.ts`,
  `index.ts`, `style.css`, `MANUAL.md`). Color-audit item (LOW-MEDIUM):
  analytic entries in the nav pane are marked by text color alone
  (`--pmd-color-analytic` on the label) — and the investigation showed
  the cue is worse than hue-confusable: it's entirely absent in dark
  mode (the nav forces uniform white text) and in the flat nav
  (`formatNavPaneByType` off overrides it to inherit). New
  `navAnalyticItalics` toggle (Accessibility, off by default, gated per
  maintainer direction rather than always-on) sets an
  `html.pmd-nav-analytic-italic` class — the `pmd-nav-flat` pattern —
  and one CSS rule italicizes `.pmd-nav-type-analytic .pmd-nav-label`.
  font-style survives both the dark-mode color override and the flat
  nav's flattening, and covers the single-doc panel and multi-pane rail
  (both render the same entry classes). Declined the audit's
  alternative (leading glyph) — italics mirror the editor surface's
  own analytic typography convention. The prep-timer 'color' label
  mode item from the same audit list was closed won't-fix: the
  text/both label modes exist precisely as the non-color channel, and
  'color' is an explicit user opt-out.

- **Accessibility: autosave inert state is now hollow, not just amber**
  (`style.css`, `MANUAL.md`). Color-audit item (MEDIUM, data-loss
  consequence): the autosave toggle's two on-states — effective (blue
  filled) vs inert/armed-but-not-firing (amber filled) — were
  geometrically identical, distinguished by hue plus a hover tooltip
  that the ribbonTooltipMode setting can disable entirely. The inert
  state now drops its background fill and draws a 1.5px dashed
  warning-color outline (outline + negative offset, not border, so no
  layout shift): filled block vs dashed hollow reads in full grayscale,
  and the dashed stroke connotes "armed but not engaged". Applied at
  the button level rather than as a hollow icon variant — the icon
  glyphs are generated assets in two icon sets (Untitled UI line +
  classic emoji), so an icon-level treatment would need new artwork in
  both for less visual payoff. A :focus-visible override restores the
  ribbon's standard solid focus ring, which the persistent outline
  would otherwise swallow. CSS-only: the state attributes
  (aria-pressed + data-autosave-effective) already existed and are
  live-maintained by refreshAutosaveBtn.

- **Fix: voice-model download offer was unreachable at session start**
  (`apps/desktop/src/voice/ipc.ts`, `voice/controller.ts`). The
  first-use flow shipped with the model-download feature intended
  Ctrl-Shift-V on a model-less install to return `voice-model-missing`
  so the controller offers the download. But `resolveVoiceAssets()`
  returned null unless BOTH libvosk and the model resolved, and the
  start handler derived `libPresent` from that collapsed null — so a
  fresh install (libvosk bundled, model not yet downloaded) always
  reported `voice-assets-missing` and showed the dead-end
  "set CARDMIRROR_VOICE_DIR" toast. Slipped through testing because the
  model had been downloaded via the settings widget (separate presence
  probe) before any cold session start. The resolver now returns
  `{ libPath, modelDir }` with independent nulls and the handler checks
  the pieces separately; `voice-assets-missing` now genuinely means
  libvosk is absent (broken install), and both toasts were reworded
  (reinstall / update guidance first, the env var demoted to a
  developer hint). Found while confirming the dev-only variant of the
  symptom: dev builds resolve libvosk from the recognizer spike's cache
  (`spikes/voice-recognizer/lib/`), not from `resources/voice/`, so
  after `npm run fetch:voice` the lib must also land there.

- **Accessibility: persistent voice-mode badge** (`voice/ui.ts`,
  `style.css`, `MANUAL.md`). Color-audit item (MEDIUM-HIGH): the voice
  session's mode was conveyed by dot hue + a matching editor-boundary
  ring — dictation green vs paint amber is a classic red-green
  confusion pair — and the only text redundancy was the transition hint
  `setMode()` wrote into the echo slot, silently overwritten by the
  next recognized word. The pill now carries a dedicated mode badge
  (command / dictation / paint / asleep chip between the dot and the
  pen badge, styled in the pen chip's language: mixed case, mode-
  colored text on the matching soft tint — accent/success/warning-soft,
  the same tokens as the editor ring) that only `setMode()` writes, so
  echo traffic can never clobber it. The color-vision preset remaps the
  tokens for free. With the badge naming the mode persistently, the
  echo's mode narration became redundant on screen and was trimmed:
  `setMode` now clears the echo for command/dictation and keeps only
  guidance the badge can't carry ('say "voice wake" to resume', 'speak
  words to ink them'), and the post-calibration message dropped
  '— command mode'. The badge is aria-live polite so mode changes stay
  announced to screen readers now that the echo no longer narrates
  them. Always-on by design (no toggle — it corrects a feedback gap
  rather than adding a presentation preference).

- **Accessibility: annotation underline shapes toggle** (`settings.ts`,
  `index.ts`, `style.css`, `MANUAL.md`). The color audit flagged the
  in-document annotation ranges as HIGH severity for red-green CVD: the
  flashcard / AI-thread / private-note decorations shared an identical
  2px-solid contrast-edge underline and differed only by tint hue
  (accent blue / purple / green) — and purple collapses toward blue when
  the red channel is impaired. New `annotationShapes` toggle (off by
  default, deferred from the audit at maintainer direction as its own
  feature) drives `data-annotation-shapes` on the document root — fifth
  use of the attribute-swap pattern — and a CSS block adds the per-kind
  underlines: comment 1px dotted, flashcard 2px solid, AI 2px dashed,
  note 3px double (double needs ≥3px to draw two lines). Per maintainer
  direction the toggle OWNS the underlines outright: with it off, all
  annotation ranges render as tint + the accent click-outline
  (.pmd-annotation-active) only — both the previous always-on 2px solid
  underline on flashcard/AI/note and the always-on dotted comment
  underline are gone. Known tradeoff, accepted by the maintainer: the
  comment dotted underline was the fix for gold-tint-on-yellow
  invisibility (a comment tint on matching highlighted text can
  vanish); with the toggle off that cue is absent. To compensate for
  losing the underlines, all four tints were strengthened ~5 points
  (comment gold 0.12→0.17 light / 0.18→0.23 dark, flashcard accent
  13%→18%, AI + note 14%→19%); the color-mix percentages reference the
  identity tokens, so the color-vision preset inherits the change. This
  mirrors in-document the text redundancy the comments column's type
  chips already provide. No decoration/plugin changes — the per-kind
  classes already existed; underlines keep the theme-contrast edge
  token, so the toggle composes with light/dark and with the
  color-vision preset.

- **Accessibility: color-vision friendly palette preset** (`settings.ts`,
  `index.ts`, `style.css`, `MANUAL.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`). New
  `colorVisionFriendly` toggle drives a `data-cvd="friendly"` attribute on
  the document root via `applyColorVision()` — the fourth use of the
  attribute-swap pattern (`data-theme`/`data-icons`/`data-motion`). Two CSS
  token blocks remap the meaning-carrying hues onto the Okabe–Ito palette
  (distinguishable under protanopia, deuteranopia AND tritanopia — one
  preset instead of three per-type ones, per maintainer decision): blue
  anchor (accent/focus/link/Aff), vermillion (AI identity + Neg), bluish
  green (notes/success/dictation/paragraph-repair), current-find-match
  stepped to vermillion with a luminance drop so it survives grayscale, and
  all category chips; a `[data-theme="dark"][data-cvd]` block brightens for
  dark. Precedence comes free from the architecture: hand-set Color
  overrides are inline styles and beat the preset; the preset beats base
  themes by cascade position. Deliberately not remapped: OOXML band colors
  (document data — mitigated by the status-bar names toggle), band
  foregrounds (pure luminance contrast already), comment gold + warning
  amber (already CVD-safe), error reds (text-redundant). Declined the
  audit's suggestion to auto-seed the highlight-override slots — a display
  preset silently rewriting other settings can't be cleanly undone; the
  description points at the companion settings instead. ARCHITECTURE §15's
  deferred list updated.

- **Accessibility: 20 more tokens in the Color overrides allowlist**
  (`settings.ts` CUSTOMIZABLE_COLOR_TOKENS, 37 → 57 entries). Added the
  meaning-carrying hues from the color-semantics audit so colorblind users
  have direct recourse before dedicated presets exist: prep-timer Aff/Neg
  (color is the ONLY signal in the timer's "color" label mode), the
  annotation accent family (AI comment purple / private note green / AI
  repair green — flagged as hue-only distinctions), hyperlink blue,
  misspelling-underline red, the due-date dot, the find-match highlight pair,
  and all ten category-chip tokens (bg + fg × heading/tag/cite/analytic/
  undertag). Translucent tokens work because the overrides widget already
  has an alpha slider with rgba round-tripping (originally added for the
  modal scrim). Deliberately excluded: `--pmd-c-band-fg-light/dark` — text
  contrast on the fixed OOXML bands is a paired decision that belongs to
  preset authoring, and a bad standalone pick makes highlighted document
  text invisible. Zero widget changes: the manifest design (runtime
  defaults via getComputedStyle, sanitizer keyed on the manifest) makes
  additions declarative.

- **Accessibility: standalone "Show highlight & shading names in the status
  bar" toggle** (`settings.ts`, `index.ts`, `MANUAL.md`). The status-bar
  cursor-color readout (actual stored highlight/shading names via
  `highlightColorLabel`) existed but was gated on the display overrides —
  the exact mechanism a colorblind user needs, locked behind an unrelated
  setting. New `showCursorColorNames` toggle shows it independently; each
  part (Hl/Sh) renders if its override OR the toggle is on. This is the
  chosen mitigation for the top hazard in the color-semantics audit (the 15
  OOXML hues carry author meaning and collapse under red-green deficiency).
  No new refresh wiring needed: the settings subscription already re-runs
  the readout, and multi-pane was already live because the pane dispatch
  re-runs setActiveView (which refreshes all status-bar chrome) per
  focused-pane transaction — the readout reads the focused pane's view.

- **Multi-pane chip: focused-chip hover glyphs are theme-invariant**
  (`src/editor/style.css`). Hovering the focused chip's outline/expand
  buttons flipped the glyph to `--pmd-c-text-strong` — black in light mode
  (visible) but WHITE in dark mode, identical to the resting on-accent
  glyph, so the hover was invisible there. The chip's accent fill is
  effectively theme-invariant, so its hover glyph now is too: new
  `--pmd-c-on-accent-hover` (#000) in the theme-invariant token group,
  applied via a focused-chip variant. (User call: match light-mode
  behavior in dark mode rather than invent a third treatment.)

- **Multi-pane chip: pressed nav/expand buttons use a box, not an accent
  glyph** (`src/editor/style.css`). `aria-pressed` on the unfocused chip's
  outline + expand buttons colored the glyph `--pmd-c-accent` (from the
  nav-rail PR, 5743557). Because outlines default open on every pane, the
  accent glyph was effectively always-on — reading as an inexplicably blue
  icon rather than a state indicator (user report). Now a subtle
  `--pmd-c-hover-strong` box with the glyph color unchanged, consolidating
  the two rules into one and matching the on-accent-overlay box the FOCUSED
  chip already uses for the same states. Also a marginal win for the
  colorblind-hazard list: state is now shape+contrast, not hue.

- **Fix: invisible hover states on multi-pane footer buttons + receive pill**
  (`src/editor/style.css`). The pane open-file button, doc-stack chip,
  slot-picker buttons, and recovery-sidebar Done button had hover rules
  pointing at the never-defined `--pmd-c-surface-3`, falling back to
  `--pmd-c-surface` — the same color as the footer they sit on, so the hover
  painted the color already underneath it. A no-op since multi-pane's
  first-cut commit (bd37dc0); surfaced by user testing after the dedup pass
  made the group visible. Now `--pmd-c-hover`, the token that phantom was
  reaching for. The receive pill separately had NO hover rule; added one at
  `--pmd-c-hover-strong` (its resting bg is already `--pmd-c-hover`) with a
  `:not(.pmd-receive-badge-unread)` guard so hovering an unread badge doesn't
  gray out its accent fill.

- **CSS dedup: 28 copy-pasted rule groups consolidated to grouped selectors**
  (`src/editor/style.css`, −249 lines / −7 KB minified). The audit's dedup map
  found ~90 rules whose bodies are exact duplicates across feature families —
  the 7× modal overlay, 9× input focus ring, 8× accent-fill CTA, 8× hover
  highlight, plus modal headers/buttons/close, layout utilities, category
  chips, and more. Each group is now ONE rule with a grouped selector list and
  a comment stating the shared role ("diverge by pulling a selector out, not
  by re-copying"). Pure CSS change — no base classes added, no TS touched
  (that's the future modal-helper refactor's job). Every consolidation was
  machine-verified first: member bodies byte-identical, or identical up to
  declaration order with no duplicate properties (9 groups were order-scrambled
  copies). Consolidated rules live at their first member's original position;
  feature-specific overrides (`:hover`, `-primary`, z-index) all remain later
  in the file. The read-mode `:is()` consolidation suggestion was deliberately
  deferred.

- **Color-compliance pass: ~100 hardcoded colors tokenized** (`src/editor/style.css`,
  `benchmark-ui.ts`, `window-coordination.ts`). Audited the whole codebase
  against ARCHITECTURE.md §15 ("a hardcoded color anywhere is a bug") via a
  multi-agent sweep, reviewer-verified. Compliance was already ~94%; the
  violations clustered in a few late-added features (repair UI, benchmark
  overlay, home-screen file tools, prep-timer Aff/Neg, OOXML band foregrounds).
  Every literal outside the token-definition blocks is now a `var(--pmd-c-*)`
  except the 15 sanctioned OOXML highlight *backgrounds* (document data) and
  `index.html`'s `theme-color` meta (read by the OS before CSS loads). Also:
  defined seven **phantom tokens** that were referenced-but-never-defined
  (`--pmd-c-aff`/`-neg` given real values; five others collapsed onto their
  fallback token), stripped 49 dead `var(--token, #literal)` fallbacks where
  the token is defined, and grouped new feature accents (repair green,
  aff/neg, band foregrounds, bench chip) as explicitly theme-invariant tokens
  so a future colorblind/high-contrast preset can add dark/preset variants in
  one block without touching call sites. User-visible effects are limited to
  the dark-mode home-screen file tools (previously stuck light — now themed)
  and two tiny light-mode hue shifts (pairing unread badge → standard accent
  blue; one repair error border → `--pmd-c-error-alt`). NOTE for future
  tokenization work: a literal-free grep is NOT sufficient verification — a
  self-referential token (`--x: var(--x)`, which a naive global find/replace
  can create) is also literal-free but renders nothing; confirm tokens
  *resolve*, and watch for a whole feature's color vanishing, not just wrong
  shades. (One such cycle was introduced and caught in dev here.)

First tier of fixes from a systematic performance & housecleaning audit
(multi-agent review across hot paths, startup, memory, the Electron main
process, and repo hygiene; every finding adversarially verified before
acceptance).

- **Settings dialog: per-row document-wide MutationObservers replaced with
  explicit disposal** (`src/editor/settings-ui.ts`). The `onDetached(el, cb)`
  helper ("run cleanup when the row leaves the DOM") created a NEW
  MutationObserver on `document.documentElement` `{childList, subtree}` per
  call — ~28 call sites per render (one per toggle row plus one per widget
  editor), so one Settings open instantiated ~60 document-wide observers,
  each pairing a `settings.subscribe()`. `close()` only hides the singleton
  overlay, so nothing ever detached: after closing Settings once, every DOM
  mutation for the rest of the session dispatched through all of them, and
  every settings change kept rebuilding hidden widget DOM (the file's own
  comment calls this subscriber class "the dominant settings lag on large
  docs"). Now `registerRowCleanup` pushes the callback onto a disposer list
  flushed by `close()` and at the top of `render()` — zero observers, and
  subscriptions live only while the dialog is open. The narrowed contract
  (cleanup at close/re-render, not at actual detach) is documented on the
  helper; no current caller detaches elements mid-session.

- **Journal + autosave: gzip moved off the main thread**
  (`src/native/codec.ts`, `src/native/index.ts`, `src/editor/index.ts`,
  `src/editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`, new `tests/native/serialize-async.test.ts`).
  Every pause in typing arms the 3s journal write (always) and the 5s
  autosave (opt-in, .cmir) — both ran `serializeNative`'s fflate `gzipSync`
  level 6 synchronously on the renderer main thread, a 50–300ms freeze on
  large docs landing right when typing resumes (doubled with autosave on;
  duplicated per record in multi-pane). New `gzipAsync` in the codec uses
  fflate's worker-backed async `gzip` with the same `{level: 6, mtime: 0}` —
  byte-identical output (unit-tested), preserving the codec's determinism
  guarantee — with a remembered fallback to sync where Workers are
  unavailable. `serializeNativeAsync` shares the envelope builder with the
  sync variant; the four debounced paths (single-doc journal + autosave via
  `serializeForSave`, per-record journal + autosave) now use it, which also
  makes MANUAL .cmir saves smoother for free. Journal/autosave rounds are
  now chained per doc (module promise / per-record WeakMap) so two in-flight
  writes can't land out of order — a pre-existing theoretical race the async
  gzip would have widened. The JSON envelope build (`doc.toJSON` +
  `JSON.stringify`) stays on the main thread by necessity (it reads the live
  doc), so the very largest docs keep a small synchronous blip per pause —
  the dominant ~70% (compression) is what moved off-thread.

- **Dead-export sweep: 17 unreferenced exported symbols deleted, 5
  annotated as spec references** (audit H-3; ten files across src/ +
  apps/desktop). A repo-wide reference scan (re-verified fresh before each
  deletion; every symbol occurred exactly once — its own declaration)
  found 23 exported symbols nothing imports or calls. Git archaeology
  sorted them: one true refactor orphan (`personaInitials` — its caller
  was removed in 92cd31b, which cleaned the import but not the export);
  the rest were born unreferenced as speculative API symmetry
  (`subscribePins`/`isManualPinned` + the whole pins-store listener
  apparatus, `removeFlashcardRangeTr`, `getMobileUnitSelection`,
  `isMultiPaneActive`, `withRepairFlash`, `clearSimilarSelection`,
  `setSpeechDocResolver`, `DEFAULT_FILE_OBJECT_KINDS`,
  `isBodyTextblock`/`isStructuralTextblock`, `findChildren`,
  `textEl`/`rootNamespaces`, `ensureId`, `voiceSessionInfo`). Deliberate
  keepers: `cardCutterEngineLoaded` (the card-cutter experiment is live —
  untouched by decision), and word-break.ts's five unit-boundary
  functions, now under an explicit "spec reference implementations"
  banner — their doc comments claimed they served Ctrl+Arrow caret
  movement, but the live caret code walks `classifyChar` directly; the
  comments now say so instead of misleading. Zero shipped-byte change
  (tree-shaking already dropped them); this is maintenance-rot and
  stale-documentation cleanup.

- **jszip dropped; the .docx container now runs on fflate**
  (`src/ooxml/docx.ts`, `src/editor/bulk-convert-ui.ts`,
  `tests/round-trip/structural-validity.test.ts`, `package.json`,
  `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`). The app shipped two DEFLATE implementations:
  fflate (the `.cmir` codec) and jszip's bundled pako fork, used only by
  the `Docx` wrapper class and bulk-convert's zip output (audit P-9). The
  `Docx` class now holds a part-name → bytes Map over fflate's
  `unzipSync`/`zipSync` (insertion order preserved, so loaded files
  re-serialize with their original part order; level 6 as before). Public
  API unchanged — async signatures kept so no caller moved — except the
  never-used `raw(): JSZip` escape hatch, deleted (it was the one thing
  leaking the JSZip type). Bulk-convert's output zips switch from jszip's
  default STORE to deflate (smaller, still standard). Verified: the full
  ooxml/import/export/round-trip suites, plus `bin/round-trip` on a real
  Word-produced .docx with images — identical structure/mark counts, the
  fflate-written file re-imports as a byte-identical fixed point, and the
  archive passes system `unzip -t`. Both a fresh export and the image-bearing
  round-trip file were then opened in Microsoft Word directly: clean open,
  no repair prompt. Main chunk 1,263 → 1,168 KB; one zip implementation and
  one fewer dependency (JSZip removed from THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES).

- **Startup: Settings subtree lazy-loaded** (`src/editor/index.ts`,
  `quick-card-search-ui.ts`, `settings-ui.ts`, new `settings-categories.ts`
  + `benchmark-state.ts`). The entry point statically imported
  `openSettings`/`closeSettings`, chaining the app's largest UI module
  (settings-ui, 4,100+ lines) plus keybindings-editor, benchmark-ui,
  benchmark.ts, and benchmark-sample's embedded card text into the main
  chunk — parsed on every launch though most sessions never open Settings
  (audit P-10). Two extractions unblocked the split: `settings-categories.ts`
  (CATEGORY_TABS / visibleCategoryTabs / SettingsTarget) so the palette's
  `s`-prefix search stops pinning settings-ui, and `benchmark-state.ts`
  (the is/setBenchmarkActive flag) so dispatchTransaction's hot-path check
  stops pinning the benchmark harness. The three openSettings call sites go
  through a cached dynamic import (recovery-ui pattern); the one
  closeSettings site is guarded on the module having been loaded (never
  fetch the chunk just to close a dialog that can't be open). Main chunk
  1,366 → 1,263 KB (−103 KB; gzip −26 KB); settings-ui is its own 110 KB
  chunk fetched on first open (instant on desktop, PWA-precached on web).
  Byte-verified the benchmark sample string left the main chunk.

- **THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md: cover everything that actually ships**
  (`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`). The file previously listed only ProseMirror
  and the Untitled UI icons, while claiming to satisfy the project's
  attribution obligations — but the bundle compiles in fast-xml-parser,
  fflate, JSZip, nspell, and tinyld (renderer) and koffi + electron-updater
  (main process), none of which ship a `node_modules/` whose notices could
  be "preserved" (audit H-10). Added an MIT section reproducing the license
  once with a per-library copyright table, cross-linked the existing
  `src/editor/fonts/LICENSES.md` for the bundled fonts, added an entry for
  the bundled Hunspell English spellcheck dictionary (SCOWL-derived), and an
  entry for Vosk (`libvosk` + models, Apache-2.0) — noting the models are now
  a runtime download (see the voice-model change) rather than installer
  contents. JSZip is documented as used under MIT (its dual MIT/GPL offer);
  it will drop off this list when P-9 (jszip → fflate) lands.

- **Voice: base recognition model + Node runtime are first-use downloads,
  not bundled** (`apps/desktop/src/voice/ipc.ts`, `preload.ts`,
  `scripts/fetch-voice-assets.cjs`, `src/editor/voice/controller.ts`,
  `settings-ui.ts`, `settings.ts`, `MANUAL.md`). The installer shipped the
  standard model (~230 MB extracted) plus a standalone Node runtime (~30 MB
  compressed) in `resources/voice/` for every user, though most never enable
  voice (audit finding P-13). Now `fetch-voice-assets.cjs` bundles only
  libvosk by default (kept in the signed artifact — a downloaded native
  `.dylib`/`.so`/`.dll` would raise Gatekeeper/library-validation issues that
  pure-data model files don't); the base model downloads on first use into
  `{userData}/voice-models/…-lgraph`, mirroring the existing large-model flow
  (`downloadLargeModel`), and the Node runtime (needed only by the large
  model — Electron's allocator SIGTRAPs on it) is fetched alongside the large
  model. `resolveVoiceAssets` now resolves lib and model independently and
  checks userData before packaged resources, so **existing fat installs keep
  working** until they update. `voice-start` returns a distinct
  `voice-model-missing` (vs `voice-assets-missing`) when libvosk is present
  but the model isn't; the controller then offers a one-time download and —
  by explicit UX decision — does NOT auto-start when it lands (a multi-minute
  download outlasts attention; a surprise hot mic is worse than a second key
  press), instead notifying via a modal so the "ready" state can't be missed.
  Settings → Accessibility → **Dictation model** gains a "Download standard
  model" button beside the existing large-model one (pre-fetch before going
  offline), with the two sharing one progress channel (tagged by `model`).
  A `--full` flag on the fetch script reproduces the old fat bundle for an
  offline-appliance build. Net: installer ~130 MB smaller, installed
  footprint ~250+ MB smaller for non-voice users. Trade-offs: first-time
  voice users wait for a one-time download (mitigated by the Settings
  pre-fetch + a MANUAL note), and an updated install that previously used
  voice re-downloads the model once.

- **Search palette: paginated results (100 per page, "show more")**
  (`src/editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`, `style.css`, `MANUAL.md`). The
  palette hard-capped every search at 50 rows with no indication anything
  was cut off. Ranking always ran over the full source list; the cap only
  bounded DOM construction — so `finishSearch` now keeps the full ranked
  list (`fullResults`) and renders a window of `RESULT_PAGE_SIZE` (100)
  rows. When more exist, a trailing "Showing X of Y — show more" row
  extends the window by a page; ArrowDown past the last rendered row does
  the same instead of wrapping (the keyboard path). A div rather than a
  button so clicks can't steal focus from the search input. The in-file
  outline browse stays deliberately un-paginated (it's a nav-pane-style
  overview); its two direct render paths keep `fullResults` in sync so no
  overflow row appears. Uncapping entirely was considered and rejected:
  file libraries at real scale (~150k indexed .cmir files on the reference
  machine) can match tens of thousands of rows on broad queries, and
  building that much DOM per keystroke would freeze the palette for
  seconds; pagination gives access to everything while bounding each
  build. Selection restores (`togglePinPath`, `restoreSelection`) also now
  use the O(1) in-place `setSelected` instead of full rebuilds.

- **Multi-pane: caret clicks no longer re-resolve the whole document's
  annotations** (`src/editor/multi-pane-shell.ts` `focusSlot`). Every pane
  mousedown called `commentsColumn.refreshFlashcardAnchors()` (full
  `flattenDoc` walk + descriptor re-resolution + a dispatched transaction +
  cards re-render) and re-attached the scroll-sync listener, even when the
  clicked pane was already focused — the `wasSame` guard existed but only
  gated `setActiveView`. Both calls now live inside the guard; the
  incremental paths (`reconcileAnchors`, highlight-range mapping,
  `lastDropCount`) keep anchors current between actual focus changes.

- **Quick-card palette: selection moves no longer rebuild the list**
  (`src/editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`). Hovering across rows or holding an
  arrow key tore down and rebuilt every result row per event
  (`innerHTML = ''` + 4–6 elements and 2–4 listeners per row + a forced
  layout) — O(rows²) across a mouse sweep, and outline-browse mode is
  deliberately uncapped, so on big files that was hundreds of rows per
  hover twitch. New `setSelected` swaps the active class/aria-selected
  between the two affected rows, refreshes the hint strip (Enter/Tab/pin
  hints are per-row-type), and scrolls the new row into view; full rebuilds
  are reserved for changes to the result set itself. Same treatment applied
  to the tag picker's `renderList`.

- **Find/Replace: incremental doc-change rescan**
  (`src/editor/find-replace-plugin.ts`, new
  `tests/editor/find-replace-incremental.test.ts`). With a query active, every
  doc-changing transaction re-ran `findMatches` over EVERY textblock in the
  doc — O(doc chars) time plus a per-block offset-map allocation per keystroke
  while the find bar was open. Now the existing matches are mapped through
  `tr.mapping` (they live in untouched textblocks, so mapping is exact) and
  only the top-level children the change touched are re-scanned
  (`changedRange` + `expandToTopLevel`, the same helpers font-size-class and
  read-mode already use), then the merged list is re-sorted with the existing
  comparator. Falls back to the full rescan when the list is at
  `FIND_MATCH_CAP` (which hits survive the cap depends on whole-doc scan
  order) or when the scope band collapses (the search re-widens doc-wide).
  The active match now survives edits by its MAPPED position, so typing above
  the current hit no longer risks bumping the selection to a different match.
  The contract — incremental result set identical to a full rescan — is
  enforced by a 14-case equivalence suite incl. a deterministic 40-edit fuzz.
  Synthetic worst case (3,000 paragraphs, 3,000 hits): 3.7ms → 0.5ms per
  keystroke; real docs (fewer matches) improve far more.

- **Find/Replace: results panel + nav markers debounced off the keystroke
  path** (`src/editor/find-replace-ui.ts`). The `input`/`keyup` handler on the
  editor DOM synchronously rebuilt up to 500 snippet rows (`innerHTML = ''`,
  `doc.resolve` + `textBetween` + a listener per row) plus a full nav-panel
  render per keystroke — the identity guards never hit because the plugin
  returns a fresh matches array per rescan. The O(1) count label stays
  synchronous; the O(matches) rebuilds now coalesce behind a 150ms trailing
  timer (cleared on bar close).

- **Startup: tinyld's language model moved out of the main chunk**
  (`src/editor/translate.ts`). A static `import { detect } from 'tinyld'`
  embedded the 577 KB n-gram model (~30% of the main chunk), parsed on every
  launch, to serve one fallback — source-language detection when MyMemory
  translation runs with source='auto'. `detectSourceLanguage` now dynamically
  imports tinyld inside its existing try/catch (chunk-load failure degrades to
  the same "pick a source language" error). Main chunk: 1,957 KB → 1,366 KB.
  Deliberately NOT the 69 KB `tinyld/light` build: tested empirically, light
  misidentifies several picker languages with confidence (uk→ru, cs→fi,
  vi→hu, fa→ar, id/ms→tr), which would silently mistranslate; the full model
  scores 27/29 on the picker language set vs light's 21/29.

- **Desktop: folder-wide Compress off the main-process event loop**
  (`apps/desktop/src/main.ts`). `host:bulk-compress` ran `gzipSync` +
  `gunzipSync` (the losslessness verify) per file on the Electron main
  process — ~100–300ms of event-loop blockage per multi-MB `.cmir`, stalling
  every window's IPC (journal writes, autosaves, menus, dialogs) for the
  duration of a run. Now `util.promisify(zlib.gzip/gunzip)` on libuv's thread
  pool; identical output bytes, level 6, same per-file order / verify / mtime
  restoration.

- **Desktop: temporary cross-window debug probe removed** (`main.ts`,
  `preload.ts`, `src/editor/host/electron-host.ts`, `src/editor/index.ts`;
  ~250 lines). The self-labeled TEMPORARY probe (`xlog` / `pathForensics` /
  `dedupeNearMisses`, the per-window focus/blur/hide/show listeners, the
  renderer→main `host:debug-log` bridge, and the `modeSwitchAskedAt` timing
  map) shipped in release builds, appending an uncapped JSON log to
  `{userData}/cross-window-debug.log` on every focus change (1.4 MB in ~3
  weeks on one machine) and running sync `realpathSync` forensics inside the
  file-open IPC handlers. The investigation it served is driven by crash
  dumps instead. The behavior it observed (mode-switch close/destroy timing,
  open-path dedup) is untouched. The stale log file is deleted at boot as a
  one-time cleanup, and the accessibility-crash telemetry that piggybacked on
  the boot log survives as two plain console lines.

- **Leftover per-keystroke debug logging removed**
  (`src/editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`, `nav-panel.ts`, `speech-doc-send.ts`).
  The `[cardmirror] wc:` warns from the 2026-06-10 stale-word-count hunt
  fired on every doc-changing transaction in multi-pane mode (plus per
  debounced flush and per `refreshWordCount`), and the mobile nav-pan
  `console.log` did forced-layout reads purely to build its message. The
  `navPanel.update` catch now reports via `console.error` instead of being
  deleted with the rest — it was the only error visibility on that path.

- **Three-pane: slot-picker keydown listener leak / swallowed digit**
  (`src/editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`). `promptForSlot` removed its
  document-level keydown listener only on the Escape / digit paths; completing
  the picker with the MOUSE leaked it, and the stale handler
  `preventDefault()`ed the next unmodified 1/2/3 typed into the editor before
  self-healing. All four resolution paths now route through one `finish()`
  that detaches the listener.

- **Desktop package declares its compiler**
  (`apps/desktop/package.json` + lockfile). `build:main` runs `tsc` but
  typescript was undeclared in the desktop tree — it resolved only via npm's
  ancestor `.bin` PATH from the ROOT devDependency, undermining the package's
  documented self-contained `npm --prefix apps/desktop ci` install. Declared
  `typescript ^5.7.2` (resolves to the same 5.9.3 the root uses).

- **Repo hygiene** (`.gitignore`): local investigation working docs
  (WHITE_SCREEN_*, CRASH_REPORTING_SCOPE, PERF_HOUSECLEANING_AUDIT,
  repro-white-screen.ts) no longer clutter `git status`.

## 0.1.0-beta.5 — 2026-07-01

- **Web: suppress password-manager DOM crawl on palette / Find focus**
  (`src/editor/autofill-ignore.ts` new, `quick-card-search-ui.ts`,
  `find-replace-ui.ts`, `README.md`). A user-supplied Chrome performance trace
  of a "slow to open" command palette showed ~2s per open spent entirely in
  extension content scripts (1Password's `injected.js` `$t`/`findLabelText`,
  a second autofill extension's `querySelectorAllIncludingWithinShadowRoots` /
  `_collectTextSample`), driven by a full-document `TreeWalker` +
  per-node `getBoundingClientRect` — triggered by the `focusin` that fires when
  the palette focuses its search `<input>`. Our own code was 0.3% of the freeze;
  it's O(DOM) so it scaled with doc size, and web-only because Electron loads no
  extensions. `autocomplete="off"` was already present and (as expected) ignored
  by the managers, so a new `autofill-ignore.ts` centralizes the vendor opt-out
  hints (`data-1p-ignore`, `data-lpignore="true"`, `data-bwignore`,
  `data-form-type="other"`) as both an attribute string (for `innerHTML`
  templates) and a `suppressAutofill(el)` helper (for `createElement`). Applied
  to the search palette input and both Find/Replace inputs. Best-effort — a
  manager may still collect page details on load/mutation — so the README gains a
  note pointing users to Chrome's per-site "run on click" extension access as the
  guaranteed fix.

- **Web edition: installable PWA + offline** (`vite.config.ts`, `public/` icons,
  `index.html`, `src/editor/host/browser-host.ts`). Added `vite-plugin-pwa`: a web
  app manifest (`display: standalone`, maskable icon, base-aware `start_url`/scope
  for the `/cardmirror/` Pages deploy) and a Workbox service worker precaching the
  app shell for offline use, `registerType: 'prompt'` so a running editor is never
  force-reloaded. The plugin is gated to the WEB build only — the Electron renderer
  reuses the same `vite build` with `--base=./`, which is detected and skips the
  plugin (no service worker under `file://`). A `NO_PWA=1` env flag builds without
  the SW for local iteration. `BrowserHost` now calls `navigator.storage.persist()`
  so the install's IndexedDB/localStorage isn't evicted.

- **Web edition: in-session in-place save** (`src/editor/host/browser-host.ts`,
  `electron-host.ts`, `host/types.ts`, `src/editor/index.ts`, `style.css`). Web
  `openFile` now uses `showOpenFilePicker` (Chromium) to obtain a
  `FileSystemFileHandle`, falling back to the handle-less `<input>` elsewhere; the
  handle is threaded through the file-state model (previously coerced to null in
  `resolveOpenedFile`, which forced Save-As), so Save writes back via
  `handle.createWritable()`. The picker's accept types now drop extensions the File
  System Access API rejects (e.g. `-` in `.cmir-journal`; still reachable via "All
  files"). New host method `ensureWritable(handle)` (no-op `true` on Electron)
  requests the readwrite permission from a user gesture at the START of Save
  (before serialize) and when autosave is toggled on — so the prompt appears on
  save intent, not on open; `saveExisting` only verifies (never prompts) so a
  gesture-less autosave fire fails cleanly. The autosave button is gated on a new
  `pmd-inplace-save` body class (Chromium browser or Electron) instead of host kind.

- **Web edition: direct clipboard read for Paste Text** (`src/editor/ribbon-commands.ts`,
  `src/editor/index.ts`, `index.html`, `style.css`, `ribbon-tooltips.ts`). F2 /
  Paste-and-Condense now read the clipboard via `navigator.clipboard.readText()` on
  the web, invoked from the keypress (the required user gesture); Chromium prompts
  once for `clipboard-read` and persists the grant, giving one-keystroke plain
  paste like desktop. On denial/unsupported, F2 falls back to the existing
  arm-a-flag workflow. The ribbon **Paste Text** button was relabelled from a toggle
  to an action ("Paste the clipboard as unformatted text") with a state-aware
  tooltip that switches to "Plain paste armed — press Ctrl/Cmd+V to paste as text"
  when the fallback arms.

- **Web edition: hide the desktop-only Card Sharing settings tab**
  (`src/editor/settings-ui.ts`, `quick-card-search-ui.ts`). Pairing is desktop-only,
  so its settings are all `electronOnly` and its "Card Sharing" tab rendered empty on
  web. Marked the category `electronOnly` and added `visibleCategoryTabs()`, which the
  settings tab strip, panels, active-tab styling, deep-link guard, and command-palette
  settings search all route through — so neither the tab nor a palette entry for it
  appears on web.

- **Web multi-tab sync for the dropzone, quick cards, and send-to-speech**
  (`src/editor/web-shared-store.ts` (new), `dropzone-store.ts`, `quick-cards-store.ts`,
  `speech-doc-registry.ts`, `speech-doc-send.ts`, `index.ts`). New `WebSharedStore<T>`
  backs a value with IndexedDB (large disk-fraction quota, past localStorage's ~5 MB)
  plus a BroadcastChannel for cross-tab live sync — best-effort, with a toast on a
  quota refusal and graceful in-memory fallback where IndexedDB/BroadcastChannel are
  absent. The **dropzone** and **quick-cards** web backends moved onto it (quick
  cards migrate once from the old `localStorage` key, left intact as a fallback).
  The dropzone stays session-scoped: on a fresh browser session — a new tab that
  isn't an in-tab reload (a `sessionStorage` marker distinguishes the multi-pane
  toggle's reload) and with no peer answering a presence ping — the stale shelf is
  cleared; concurrent tabs share it. **Send-to-speech** gains a web cross-tab path:
  a `WebSpeechDocResolver` shares the speech-doc designation across tabs
  (`localStorage` + `storage` event), and `sendToSpeech` broadcasts the serialized
  slice over a BroadcastChannel with an ack — the tab owning that uid's view inserts
  it through the SAME `insertSpeechSlice` the Electron receive path uses (extracted
  as `applyIncomingSlice`; no duplicate handler), and a no-ack timeout surfaces the
  "speech doc isn't open in any tab" notice (mirroring Electron's window-gone case).
  The speech-stack ribbon buttons now appear on web single-doc (`pmd-multi-window`
  gated on the browser host too), and the desktop-only "New Speech Document" error
  was rewritten to point users at the Three-pane workspace.

- **Web edition: multi-window in the installed PWA** (`src/editor/host/browser-host.ts`,
  `host/types.ts`, `src/editor/index.ts`). The browser host can now spawn editor
  windows, so New Document / New Speech Document / opening a second file open a new
  window (like the desktop editions) instead of replacing the current doc.
  `spawnWindow` hands the doc payload to the new window through IndexedDB (a new
  `spawns` object store, DB bumped to v2) keyed by an id in a `?spawn=` URL param; the
  spawned window reads it back in `getInitialDoc` (one-shot — strips the param via
  `replaceState` and deletes the record), and the existing `mountFromSpawnPayload`
  boot path mounts it, reusing the same flow Electron uses so the `markAsSpeech`
  designation carries across. `getInitialDoc` is now consulted at boot regardless of
  the window's own `canSpawnWindow` (a spawned tab isn't itself standalone but must
  still mount its payload). `canSpawnWindow` is gated to an installed PWA and made
  STICKY via a `localStorage` flag once the app has run standalone, so a window Chrome
  opens as a plain tab (rather than a standalone app window) still behaves as
  multi-window — New Document spawns rather than overwriting, and New Speech Document
  doesn't refuse. Windows are opened with a `rel="noopener"` anchor click rather than
  `window.open`: Chrome's navigation capturing routes a navigation into the installed
  app window only when it targets a non-auxiliary browsing context (no opener), and
  `window.open` always creates an auxiliary context — so it's excluded from capture and
  lands in a browser tab even with the app's link-capturing enabled (Chrome offers only
  a manual "Open in app" button). A noopener link click is capturable, so an installed
  PWA with "open in app" set opens spawned windows as real app windows (Chrome 139+,
  HTTPS); elsewhere — a plain tab, `http://localhost`, or capture disabled — they open
  as tabs, and the editor behaves identically either way. One current limit:
  a file opened into a spawned window loses its `FileSystemFileHandle` (Save-As only),
  since the handle isn't yet threaded through the spawn payload.

- **Web edition: cross-window coordination + multi-pane mode-switch**
  (`src/editor/window-coordination.ts` (new), `index.ts`, `multi-pane-shell.ts`,
  `settings-ui.ts`). A single persistent BroadcastChannel per window
  (`installWindowCoordination`) is the browser counterpart to Electron's main
  process: it tracks live peers (hello / here / bye) and answers coordination
  requests, with every handler ignoring its own `WINDOW_ID` (a channel delivers to
  same-window instances too). The multi-pane mode switch now manages the other
  windows the way desktop does through main. One-window-per-doc → three-pane: the
  initiating window broadcasts please-close and collects each peer's `{uid,dirty}`
  (their journals ride in the shared journal store; only the uid list travels,
  folded into the mode-switch marker), and each peer journals + self-closes via
  `closeSelfWithFallback` — `window.close()` from a message handler has no user
  activation and is usually blocked, so a window that can't close covers its stale
  content with a "moved" overlay instead. Three-pane → one-window-per-doc can't
  reopen the other docs in their own windows (opening a window needs a user
  gesture, and the post-reload spawn runs during boot; browsers also cap ~1
  `window.open` per gesture), so `reduceToFocusedForModeSwitch` keeps the focused
  doc and closes the rest through the pane's existing save / discard flow (Cancel
  aborts the switch); Settings closes first so those prompts appear over the
  workspace. Singleton enforcement: a window booting into three-pane asks whether
  an older three-pane window is already open (by `openedAt`, ties by id) and, if
  so, bounces a browser-spawned duplicate (Cmd+N / app icon) via
  `closeSelfWithFallback` rather than opening a second workspace. All of it no-ops
  on Electron and degrades to nothing without BroadcastChannel.

- **Web edition: cross-window same-file guard + handle-preserving journals**
  (`window-coordination.ts`, `index.ts`, `multi-pane-shell.ts`,
  `host/browser-host.ts`, `host/types.ts`). Opening a file already open in another
  window is now refused on the web (the desktop path-registry check,
  `openPathCheck`, was Electron-only): `isFileOpenInAnotherWindow` routes Electron
  → `openPathCheck`, web → a BroadcastChannel query that broadcasts the handle and
  resolves true if a peer matches it via `FileSystemFileHandle.isSameEntry`,
  short-circuiting when this window is alone. For that to survive a three-pane mode
  switch (or crash recovery), web journals now PRESERVE the `FileSystemFileHandle`
  — `JournalEntry.handle` widened to `unknown`, the two `writeJournal` callers pass
  it through, and the browser `writeJournal` stores it (handles ARE
  structured-cloneable into IndexedDB; the prior code wrongly forced `handle:
  null`, so a mode-switched doc came back with no file identity). The restored
  handle carries `prompt` permission, which is fine: `isSameEntry` needs no grant
  and in-place save re-requests on first write.

- **Web edition: single-file document tools** (`src/editor/web-file-tools.ts`
  (new), `clean-ui.ts`, `bulk-convert-ui.ts`, `bulk-compress-ui.ts`,
  `home-screen.ts`, `index.ts`, `style.css`). The Clean / Bulk convert / Bulk
  compress home-screen tools were Electron-only (folder-recursive I/O) and absent
  on web. Single-file web versions run each transform on one picked file:
  `cleanDocumentBytes` (Clean), `convertBytes` in the extension-inferred direction
  (Convert, `.docx` ↔ `.cmir`), and `parseNative` + `serializeNative` preserving
  threads + docId (Compress — `.cmir` is gzip-wrapped, so a round-trip
  recompresses). A shared `runWebFileTool` drives pick → validate → a two-phase
  progress modal → Save. The modal's spinner is a compositor-driven `transform:
  rotate` animation, so it keeps turning even while the CPU-bound transform blocks
  the main thread; and the actual save is deferred to a Save button on the "ready"
  step, because `showSaveFilePicker` throws without a user gesture and the original
  click's activation is long gone once the transform finishes. Output goes through
  `host.saveAs` (File System Access picker on Chromium, download elsewhere); the
  home-screen copy is host-aware (single file vs. folder batch).

- **Web edition: Paste and Destructively Condense; disable the reload shortcut**
  (`src/editor/ribbon-availability.ts`, `index.ts`). `pasteCondensed` already read
  the clipboard through the shared `readClipboardText` (Electron IPC or the async
  Clipboard API) but its ribbon / palette visibility was still hard-gated to
  Electron; it's now shown wherever a clipboard read is available. Separately, the
  browser build disables the reload shortcut (`Mod+R` / `F5`) with a capture-phase
  `keydown` + `preventDefault`, matching the desktop build's removed reload
  accelerator — an accidental reload would discard the in-memory session, while
  programmatic reloads (the mode switch) are unaffected.

- **Per-document outline close + vertical resize in the multi-doc rail**
  (`editor/nav-panel.ts`, `editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`, `editor/style.css`). In
  the multi-doc workspace the navigation rail stacks one `NavigationPanel`
  section per open document. The section header's × previously called
  `settings.set('navPaneVisible', false)`, which hid the whole rail for every
  document; and the sections were locked to `flex: 1 1 0`, so they always split
  the rail evenly. `NavigationPanel` now takes an optional `onClose` callback —
  when set (multi-doc), the × routes to it instead of the global setting; the
  single-doc panel keeps the old "hide the pane" behavior. The shell wires
  `onClose` to a per-slot `navHidden` flag and a new `reconcileNavRail()` that is
  the single source of truth for section visibility (expand mode → only the
  expanded slot; otherwise every populated slot, minus individually-closed ones),
  the resize handles, the per-slot flex weights, and whether the rail shows at
  all. When every open document's outline is closed the rail is dropped
  (`pmd-multi-nav-empty` body class zeroes `#app`'s left margin, mirroring the
  global nav toggle). Each non-topmost section grows a top-edge `row-resize`
  handle; dragging it trades flex weight between the section and its visible
  neighbour above (combined weight held constant so the rest hold their size),
  double-click resets to an even split, and any composition change (open / close
  / hide / show) re-evens the split so a reopened section doesn't inherit a stale
  weight. Each pane's title chip gains an outline-toggle button (the reopen
  affordance and a one-click hide), pressed when the outline is shown. The
  global nav-pane toggle (`toggleNavPane`, the rail's toggle button, and the
  restore pull-tab) now cooperates with these per-slot flags instead of
  overriding them: in multi-doc mode it routes to `toggleAllNav()` (any slot
  outline hidden → show all; none hidden → hide all) and the pull-tab routes to
  `setAllNavHidden(false)`, while `reconcileNavRail()` writes `navPaneVisible`
  back so the toggle's pressed state always matches whether any outline is
  actually showing — previously the global toggle was a separate override, so
  hiding all three outlines individually left it stuck reading "on" and pressing
  it did nothing. *Per-document outlines contributed by
  [@coralynnkc](https://github.com/coralynnkc); global-toggle integration built
  on top.*

## 0.1.0-beta.4 — 2026-06-29

- **Discontinuous (Ctrl/Cmd) selection** (`editor/word-selection-plugin.ts`,
  `editor/similar-selection-plugin.ts`, `editor/style.css`,
  `tests/editor/discontinuous-selection.test.ts`). Ctrl + drag (Cmd on macOS —
  Ctrl-click is the OS context menu there) adds an arbitrary range to the
  selection; Ctrl/Cmd-click adds the word under the pointer, folding the current
  normal selection in as the first range. It reuses the Select Similar "shadow
  selection" machinery: the ranges populate the plugin's match set via a new
  `setManualShadowSelection`, so the ~15 format commands that already consume
  `getOperatingRanges` act across all of them in one transaction — no per-command
  work. A new `copy` DOM handler on the shadow plugin serializes every range (text
  joined by newlines, HTML concatenated) when a shadow set is active and the PM
  selection is collapsed; cut/paste are intentionally not special-cased, and any
  real edit / Escape / plain click clears the set (the existing shadow dismissal).
  The set renders with the native-`::selection` accent tint — a `style` flag on
  the shadow state keeps it distinct from Select Similar's dashed outline — and
  the live drag shows as a `pending` decoration rather than the real selection, so
  the already-selected ranges aren't dismissed mid-drag.

- **Renderer accessibility tree disabled by default to work around a Chromium
  accessibility crash** (`apps/desktop/src/main.ts`,
  `apps/desktop/src/accessibility-pref.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/preload.ts`,
  `editor/host/electron-host.ts`, `editor/settings.ts`, `editor/settings-ui.ts`,
  `tests/desktop/accessibility-pref.test.ts`,
  `tests/editor/settings-backup.test.ts`). Crash dumps from two independent
  Windows users (seven dumps total) symbolicated to a byte-identical, deterministic
  `CHECK` failure in Blink's accessibility serialization —
  `blink::AXBlockFlowData::ComputeNeighborOnLine`, reached via `RunAccessibilitySteps
  → AXObjectCacheImpl::SerializeUpdatesAndEvents → ui::AXTreeSerializer →
  AXObject::SerializeInlineTextBox → SerializeLineAttributes →
  AXInlineTextBox::NeighboringOnLineWithAXBlockFlowIterator`. The path runs only when
  an assistive-tech / UI-Automation client (screen reader, Windows Voice Access, …)
  turns on the `kInlineTextBoxes` AX mode, and it trips over the dense, overlapping
  highlight/underline run structure of debate cards (the triggering 1AC had 311
  paragraphs but 2,582 runs / 825 highlights / 1,478 underlines). The bug is in
  the new `AXBlockFlowIterator` line-navigation code and is unfixed on current
  Chromium trunk (Electron 42.2.0 = Chromium 148; the one related fix,
  crbug `461193182`, is already included and covers a different case). CardMirror
  isn't on an old Chromium, so an Electron bump won't help.

  `main` now appends `--disable-renderer-accessibility` at startup unless a
  machine-local pref opts back in (`{userData}/accessibility-pref.json`,
  `apps/desktop/src/accessibility-pref.ts`; fail-safe — anything but an explicit
  `true` reads as disabled, so a missing/corrupt/restored-backup file can never
  silently re-expose the crash). The switch is read before `app.whenReady()`
  (Chromium reads switches at process start). New **Settings → Accessibility →
  "Screen reader support"** is an Off/On segmented control (matching the reduce-motion
  / theme controls) that writes the pref via IPC and offers an immediate relaunch;
  it shows a "restart pending" notice only when the selection differs from the state
  actually applied this session (`host:get-accessibility-tree-applied` exposes the
  startup value). The boot log records `rendererAccessibilityTreeDisabled` and
  `accessibilitySupportActive` so a pasted log confirms whether the trigger is
  present on a given machine. Default-off is the fix; opting in re-activates the
  known crash and the setting says so.

## 0.1.0-beta.3 — 2026-06-29

- **Nav-pane caret-tracking no longer flickers to the next heading while typing**
  (`editor/nav-panel.ts`, `editor/index.ts`, `editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`,
  `tests/editor/nav-panel-caret-tracking.test.ts`). The nav pane caches each
  heading's doc position at render time and rebuilds on a ~200ms idle debounce;
  `setCaretHeading` (which picks the last heading whose cached pos ≤ caret) runs
  synchronously on every keystroke, so it compared a post-edit caret against
  pre-edit positions. Typing on the bottom-most line just above a heading
  advanced the caret past that heading's STALE position, briefly lighting it
  until the debounced rebuild refreshed positions. New
  `NavigationPanel.remapPositions(mapping)` maps the cached `liEntries` positions
  (and their `data-pos`) forward through a doc change; it runs on every
  doc-changing transaction alongside the heavy-update scheduling in both the
  single-pane (`index.ts`) and per-pane (`multi-pane-shell.ts`) dispatch hooks,
  so cached positions track the caret's frame and the comparison is always
  current. Also removes the same latent staleness for nav click-to-jump between
  rebuilds. Test reproduces the stale-position mis-selection and confirms the
  remap keeps the highlight on the correct heading.

- **Custom dash autoformat** (`editor/custom-dash-plugin.ts` new,
  `editor/settings.ts`, `editor/settings-ui.ts`, `editor/index.ts`,
  `tests/editor/custom-dash.test.ts`). New `customDashPlugin()` (pushed in
  `buildEditorPlugins` next to `smartQuotesPlugin`), gated on `customDashEnabled`
  + `customDashStyle` (`'en' | 'en-spaced' | 'em' | 'em-spaced'`, default `'em'`;
  spaced variants add a regular space each side). `handleTextInput` converts on
  the THIRD hyphen — when the typed `-` completes `---` (two hyphens immediately
  before within the textblock), it replaces all three with the configured output
  in one `insertText` and stamps a `converted` meta. `handleKeyDown` Backspace
  reverts that output back to the literal `---` within the one-transaction undo
  window (the same plugin-state pattern as the smart-quotes revert). Settings UI:
  a custom `customDash` kind rendering a checkbox + an output dropdown (disabled
  until checked) in the Editing category. Converting on the third hyphen rather
  than deferring to the next character is why only `---` is offered — a `--` rule
  would have to fire on the second hyphen and could never coexist with `---`.

- **Configurable preset filename prefixes + overwrite guard in fixed-folder
  mode** (`editor/settings.ts`, `editor/save-as-ui.ts`, `editor/index.ts`,
  `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`, `tests/editor/settings-backup.test.ts`). New string
  settings `sendDocPrefix` / `readDocPrefix` / `markedDocPrefix` (General,
  `kind: 'text'`, `dependsOn: 'prefixPresetSaveFilenames'`, defaults SEND_ /
  READ_ / MARKED_); the previously-hardcoded literals in the Save-As presets
  (`save-as-ui.ts`) and the silent `runSaveSendDocFlow` / `runSaveMarkedCardsFlow`
  (`index.ts`) now read them, and the `prefixPresetSaveFilenames` toggle's
  label/description were de-hardcoded. Overwrite guard: both silent flows now
  ALWAYS pass the source document's path as `siblingHandle` and gate the silent
  write on a per-mode resolvable destination
  (`fixedFolderMode ? folder !== null : sourceHandle !== null`), so the desktop's
  existing `resolve(target) === resolve(siblingHandle)` collision check fires in
  fixed-folder mode too — a custom/empty prefix colliding with the original →
  'collision' → Save As dialog — not just same-folder mode. The IPC/main code is
  unchanged (only its comment); the fix is renderer-side. Tests cover the prefix
  defaults + custom/empty values.

- **Per-editor (unlinked) body-text zoom** (`editor/settings.ts`,
  `editor/settings-ui.ts`, `editor/index.ts`, `editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`,
  `editor/drag-editor-surface.ts`, `editor/mobile-shell.ts`,
  `editor/mobile-settings-ui.ts`, `tests/editor/settings-backup.test.ts`). Body
  zoom was a synced, persisted `zoomPct` setting applied through one
  `--editor-zoom` var on `documentElement`, so it linked across windows
  (storage-event sync) and panes (shared var). Replaced with: (1) a new
  synced/persisted `defaultZoomPct` setting (Accessibility, 50–200%/step-10,
  default 100, clamped editor) = the value editors OPEN at; (2) live body zoom
  that's per-editor and transient — single-pane keeps a module `liveZoomPct`
  (per window, applied via the per-window `--editor-zoom` var), multi-pane keeps
  a `zoomPct` on each `DocRecord` applied INLINE to its `.pmd-pane-editor` so
  panes don't share. The zoom commands/buttons/Ctrl-wheel run through a
  `zoomActiveBy`/`zoomActiveReset` shim that routes to the focused pane in
  multi-pane via new `enableMultiDocMode` hooks (`zoomFocusedBy`/
  `zoomFocusedReset`), mirroring the per-pane `readMode` pattern; the status-bar
  % uses a `setZoomStateResolver` and refreshes on `setActiveView` focus change.
  The settings subscriber no longer re-applies zoom (the default governs only new
  editors, never re-zooms an open one). `applyZoomToTarget` / `clampZoom` /
  `getLiveZoomPct` / `setLiveZoomPct` are exported for the shell + mobile;
  `drag-editor-surface` reads each editor element's effective `zoom` instead of
  the setting. Chrome scale (`chromeScalePct`) is untouched — still a synced
  global via `setZoomFactor`. The old persisted `zoomPct` is intentionally not
  migrated (zoom no longer persists). Tests cover the `defaultZoomPct` clamp /
  default.

- **Paste and Destructively Condense command** (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`,
  `editor/ribbon-groups.ts`, `editor/ribbon-availability.ts`,
  `tests/editor/paste-condensed.test.ts`). New desktop-only `pasteCondensed`
  ribbon command — unbound by default, Editing-utilities group, palette aliases —
  a direct PM Command modeled on `pasteAsText`: reads the OS clipboard via
  `electron.clipboardReadText()`, pastes through `applyPlainPasteFromText` with
  its settings-driven condense-on-paste suppressed, then runs a forced
  `condenseMerge({ withPilcrows: false, headingMode: ctx.headingMode() })` over
  the captured inserted range — equivalent to F2 then Alt-F3 (Condense Without
  Paragraph Integrity) on the pasted content, regardless of the user's condense
  settings. Web-gated via `isRibbonCommandAvailable` (`getElectronHost() !== null`,
  like `toggleVoice`) plus a body self-guard that returns false so the key falls
  through. The orchestration is extracted into an exported
  `pasteTextAndCondense(view, text, headingMode)` (paste → capture range →
  destructive condense) for testing; the test covers a 3-line paste merging into
  a single card_body with no surviving breaks, and the empty no-op.

- **Save Marked Cards** (`export/transform-for-export.ts`, `editor/save-as-ui.ts`,
  `editor/index.ts`, `editor/ribbon-commands.ts`, `editor/ribbon-groups.ts`,
  `editor/settings.ts`, `editor/settings-ui.ts`,
  `tests/export/transform-for-export.test.ts`). New `markedCardsOnly` branch in
  `transformForExport` → `extractMarkedCards`: keeps only doc-level `card` nodes
  whose subtree contains a reading-marker run (the `font_color` mark at FF0000,
  via the exported `isReadingMarkerColor`), flat — headings, analytics, and
  unmarked cards drop. `countMarkedCards` is exported for an empty-doc guard.
  Threaded through `serializeForSave` (optional opt), the modal
  (`SaveAsResult`/`buildPreset`/`confirmWith` + a new "Marked Doc" preset,
  `MARKED_` prefix), and `runSaveAsFlow` (a derived/lossy export → working doc
  identity untouched). New `saveMarkedCards` ribbon command (label "Save Marked
  Cards", default `Mod-Alt-m`, File group, palette aliases) → the new
  `runSaveMarkedCardsFlow`, modeled on `runSaveSendDocFlow`: silent write to
  `markedCardsDestination` (`sameFolder`/`fixedFolder` → `markedCardsFolder`)
  reusing the Send Doc IPC, with dialog fallback, `MARKED_` prefix honoring
  `prefixPresetSaveFilenames`, and format from `defaultSaveFormat`; toasts + no-op
  when nothing is marked. New `markedCardsDestination`/`markedCardsFolder`
  settings (4-step + metadata, `electronOnly`) — the same/fixed-folder radio
  editor was generalized (`buildDestinationEditor`) to serve both Send Doc and
  Marked Cards. Tests cover marker detection anywhere in a card
  (tag/body/cite/undertag), cards-only (analytics excluded), the flat output,
  `countMarkedCards`, and the empty case.

- **Bottom scroll runway gated on the whole pill tray, not just the dropzone**
  (`editor/index.ts`, `editor/style.css`). The editable's `padding-bottom: 4.5rem`
  runway (so the last line clears the fixed bottom-left tray) was gated on
  `html:not(.pmd-dropzone-pill-hidden)` — driven solely by `showDropzonePill`. But
  the send/receive pills share that tray and are gated on `pairingEnabled`, so
  pairing-on / dropzone-pill-off left the pills covering the last line with no
  runway. `applyPillVisibility()` now also toggles `pmd-pill-tray-active` on
  `<html>` = `showDropzonePill || pairingEnabled`, and both runway rules — single-
  pane (`#editor .ProseMirror`) and multi-pane (`.pmd-pane-pill-anchored
  .pmd-pane-editor .ProseMirror`) — gate on `html.pmd-pill-tray-active` instead.
  `pmd-dropzone-pill-hidden` still hides the dropzone root (style.css ~3198); only
  the runway gate moved. `positionDropzone` already tags the correct anchor pane.

- **Smart quotes (typing-time) + Flip Quote Direction command**
  (`editor/smart-quotes-plugin.ts` new, `editor/flip-quote-direction.ts` new,
  `editor/index.ts`, `editor/settings.ts`, `editor/ribbon-commands.ts`,
  `editor/ribbon-groups.ts`, `tests/editor/smart-quotes.test.ts`,
  `tests/editor/flip-quote-direction.test.ts`). `smartQuotesPlugin()` uses a
  `handleTextInput` prop (same shape as `type-over-boundary.ts`), gated on a new
  `smartQuotes` boolean setting (default off). `curlFor(typed, prev)` picks the
  direction from the preceding character via PM's built-in opening set —
  whitespace, `{[(<`, straight quotes, opening curly quotes — PLUS the em-dash and
  en-dash (Word's behavior PM lacks); the closing single quote doubles as the
  apostrophe. Word-parity revert: the curl transaction stamps a meta recording
  `{from, straight}`, the plugin state holds it for exactly one transaction, and a
  `handleKeyDown` Backspace handler restores the straight character when the
  cursor sits right after the just-curled char (defensively re-checking it's still
  a curly quote). Registered in `buildEditorPlugins()` (one push). The
  `flipQuoteDirection` ribbon command (unbound by default, Editing-utilities
  group, returned directly from `getRibbonCommand` since it's a plain PM Command)
  swaps every curly quote in a non-empty selection to its opposite direction via
  `tr.replaceWith(pos, pos+1, schema.text(flipped, marks))` (same length, marks
  preserved); a collapsed selection is a no-op. Produces curly characters that
  the existing `normalizeForMatch`/`foldQuotes` fold for search. Aliases on the
  command and the setting (`curly quotes`, `smart quotes`, `flip quotes`, `fix
  apostrophe`, …).

- **Find + Paragraph Integrity: dash and ellipsis normalization**
  (`editor/word-break.ts`, `editor/find-replace-plugin.ts`,
  `editor/repair-paragraph-plugin.ts`, `tests/editor/quote-fold.test.ts`,
  `tests/editor/repair-paragraph.test.ts`). New `normalizeForMatch(s)` returns the
  folded string PLUS an index map back to original offsets. It folds curly quotes
  (via `foldQuotes`), every `\p{Dash}` character → ASCII `-` (hyphen, en/em dash,
  minus sign, two/three-em dash, fullwidth hyphen, …), and collapses both an ASCII
  `...` and the `…` char to a single canonical `…`. Quotes/dashes are
  length-preserving (all single BMP chars); the `...`→`…` collapse (3→1) is the
  only length-changing step, which is why the map exists — both matchers now
  translate match start/end (and Find's whole-word boundary checks) through it, so
  highlights, Replace ranges, and the split-before-phrase still land on the real
  characters even when an earlier `...` shifted offsets. Replaces the previous
  length-preserving `foldQuotes`-only path in both matchers. Soft hyphen U+00AD
  (not a `\p{Dash}` char, and invisible) is intentionally left unfolded. Tests
  cover the folds, the map, both directions for each class, and that an earlier
  `...` doesn't shift a later match.

- **"Cycle Timer Preset" command + shared timer-profile module**
  (`editor/timer-profile.ts` new, `editor/ribbon-commands.ts`,
  `editor/ribbon-groups.ts`, `editor/index.ts`, `editor/settings-ui.ts`,
  `editor/settings.ts`, `tests/editor/timer-profile.test.ts`). New bindable
  `cycleTimerPreset` ribbon command — unbound by default, in the View group,
  label "Cycle Timer Preset (College → High School → Pomodoro)". Wired through
  `ctx.cycleTimerPreset` → `cycleTimerProfile()`: it advances the active
  `timerProfile` College → High School → Pomodoro (wrapping), applies that
  profile's saved speech presets + prep total to the live settings, refills the
  prep clocks (`resetTimer`), makes the timer visible, and toasts the profile
  label. The profile-switch logic moved into a new `timer-profile.ts`
  (`applyTimerProfile` / `cycleTimerProfile` / `TIMER_PROFILE_LABELS`), which the
  Settings profile picker (`buildTimerProfileEditor`) now also calls, so the two
  can't drift. Aliases modeled on `cycleTheme`:
  `switch`/`toggle`/`next`/`change timer preset`, plus `timer profile` and
  `timer preset`; the `timerProfile` setting also gained
  `aliases: ['timer preset', 'timer presets']` so settings search matches both
  terms. (The first pass mistakenly cycled the three within-profile speech
  presets via a `cycleSpeechPreset`; that was removed.)

- **Timer: editable prep clocks, prep-aware display, capped/focus-stable
  durations** (`editor/timer-state.ts`, `editor/timer-ui.ts`, `editor/style.css`,
  `editor/settings.ts`, `editor/settings-ui.ts`,
  `tests/editor/timer-state.test.ts`). Five related changes:
  - *Editable prep time.* The display click-to-edit is no longer gated to speech
    mode (`if (s.running || s.mode !== 'speech')` → `if (s.running)`), and commit
    now routes through the new `setActiveRemainingMs` (renamed from
    `setSpeechRemainingMs`), which writes the active mode's base — speech, or the
    aff/neg prep base. Since prep balances only zero on Reset, an edit persists
    across mode switches. Covered by a new `timer-state.test.ts`.
  - *Prep-aware big display.* `render()` sets `data-mode` on the display; CSS
    keyed on `data-prep-label` + `[data-mode="affPrep"|"negPrep"]` gives it the
    same aff/neg color (and an `A:`/`N:` `::before` for the text/both modes) as
    the prep buttons. The `::before` keeps the editable time text node clean.
  - *Prep-button padding.* In the text/both modes the aff/neg buttons get
    `padding: 0 1.7rem` so the prefix isn't crowded against a 4-digit time (the
    `min-width: 3.2rem` floor means smaller bumps are absorbed by centering).
  - *Durations capped at 99.* The durations editor `<input max>`/guard and the
    three sanitize bounds (live `timerPrepMinutes`, per-profile `prepMinutes`,
    and `sanitizeNumberTriple` for live + per-profile speech presets) went
    `999` → `99`. Flash seconds (separate `sanitizeFlashSeconds`) are unaffected.
  - *Durations editor focus.* `buildTimerProfileDurationsEditor` subscribed to
    `settings.subscribe(buildFields)`, so each keystroke's `settings.set` tore
    down and rebuilt the focused input. It now rebuilds only when the active
    `timerProfile` actually changes (tracked via `lastProfile`), preserving focus
    during multi-digit entry.

- **iOS web file-open: drop `accept` so custom extensions are selectable**
  (`editor/host/browser-host.ts`). iOS's Files picker maps a file input's
  `accept` to UTIs and greys out any extension with no UTI — our `.cmir` /
  `.cmir-journal` (`.docx` has one, so it stayed pickable) — making them
  unselectable; desktop browsers honor the raw extension list, so it only
  reproduced on-device. Added `isIOS()` (UA `iP(hone|od|ad)`, plus a
  touch-capable `MacIntel` for iPadOS-as-desktop-Safari) and, in `openOnce`,
  skip setting `accept` on iOS so any file can be chosen; the format is validated
  downstream. No behavior change off iOS. Not unit-tested (UA + iOS-picker
  runtime behavior) — verify on a real device.

- **Repair Paragraph Integrity: in-workflow undo (Mod-Z)**
  (`editor/repair-paragraph-plugin.ts`, `editor/repair-paragraph-ui.ts`,
  `tests/editor/repair-paragraph.test.ts`). The bar tracks a per-session action
  stack (`split` / `split-designate` / `designate`), pushed on each confirm. The
  document-level handler (reusing the Escape gating — defers to a supervening
  modal or the command bar) intercepts Mod-Z (no Shift/Alt) while the workflow is
  open and reverses the most recent action: a new `{ type: 'popDesignation' }`
  meta drops the designation it added (if any), and prosemirror-history `undo`
  reverses the split's doc change (if any). The designate-only case (Ctrl-Enter
  on an already-broken paragraph — no doc change) is reversed by `popDesignation`
  alone. No-op once the session's actions are exhausted, so it never reaches into
  pre-workflow history, and it's consumed while open so it can't fall through to
  the editor's global undo. Added a `popDesignation` plugin test; the full undo
  path (needs the history plugin + view) is verified in the dev build.

- **Repair Paragraph Integrity: Ctrl-Enter designates a paragraph that already
  starts a line** (`editor/repair-paragraph-plugin.ts`,
  `editor/repair-paragraph-ui.ts`, `tests/editor/repair-paragraph.test.ts`).
  `buildSplitForSingleMatch` returned null when the single match was at
  `parentOffset === 0` (the phrase already leads its paragraph). Now plain Enter
  still returns null, but Ctrl-Enter returns a no-split transaction emitting a
  new `{ type: 'designate', pos }` meta that records the paragraph for
  indent-on-exit and clears the query — the only way to mark a card's
  already-broken first body paragraph, which can't be split. `splitAtSingleMatch`
  now returns `'split' | 'designated' | null`, and the bar's hint distinguishes
  the two ("Marked for indent — it already starts a line." vs "Paragraph break
  added…"). Test added: Ctrl-Enter at paragraph start leaves the doc unchanged,
  bumps `designatedCount` to 1, and exit indents that paragraph.

- **Repair Paragraph Integrity: Escape exits from anywhere**
  (`editor/repair-paragraph-ui.ts`). The Escape handler lived only on the bar's
  input, so once focus left the bar (e.g. clicking back into the card) there was
  no exit avenue. Moved Escape to a capture-phase document handler
  (`onDocKeyDown`, installed on open / removed on close) so it fires regardless
  of focus and ahead of the editor. It defers — checked in the capture phase,
  before anything pops itself in bubble — to a supervening overlay-stack modal
  (`isAnyOverlayOpen()`) or the open command bar (`quickCardSearchUI.isOpen()`),
  so those absorb Escape first. The input's own Escape branch was removed so
  there's a single Escape path.

- **Multi-pane nav pane tracks the caret** (`editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`).
  Single-doc highlights the caret's heading via `navPanel.setCaretHeading` in its
  `dispatchTransaction` (plus a re-apply after each outline rebuild); the
  per-pane dispatch never did, so the three-pane nav didn't follow the cursor.
  Added, mirroring single-doc: (1) `record.navPanel.setCaretHeading(next.
  selection.from)` on caret-position change in the per-pane `dispatchTransaction`;
  (2) an initial `setCaretHeading` right after `navPanel.attach`; (3) a re-apply
  after each `navPanel.update(doc)` (the debounced heavy-update flush and
  `flushHeavyUpdateNow`) — since `render()` rebuilds entries, this keeps a
  structural edit from leaving the wrong heading lit. Per-pane, so each pane
  tracks its own cursor.

- **Move-container commands: reorder the cursor's outline node up/down**
  (`editor/move-container.ts` (new), `editor/ribbon-commands.ts`,
  `editor/ribbon-groups.ts`, `tests/editor/move-container.test.ts`,
  `tests/editor/ribbon-groups.test.ts`). `moveContainerUp` / `moveContainerDown`
  find the deepest heading whose `computeHeadingRange` encloses the cursor (the
  card / analytic unit, or a pocket/hat/block section) and move that range one
  spot among same-level top-level items. Mechanism: each top-level child carries
  an outline level (card / analytic = 4, block = 3, hat = 2, pocket = 1; loose
  content = deepest); the move skips items *deeper* than the grabbed level (a
  sibling's contents travel as a unit) and lands beside the first item at that
  level or shallower — so a card hops a shallower block heading in one step
  (entering/leaving the section) while a block hops a whole sibling block section.
  Boundaries flow (reparenting); no-op when there's no same-level-or-shallower
  neighbor; the cursor stays in the moved container so the key repeats. Bound by
  default to `Mod-Alt-ArrowUp` / `Mod-Alt-ArrowDown` (distinct from the
  single-modifier `Ctrl/Alt-Arrow` caret nav; search aliases move/reorder
  up/down), placed in the Editing-utilities ribbon group. Also added a
  ribbon-groups↔registry coverage test — a command missing from a group
  previously only crashed at boot, not in the suite.

- **Same-type structural re-press: uniform reset of indent + font-size +
  font-color** (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`, `tests/editor/ribbon-commands.test.ts`).
  Centralized the cleared direct marks into `REAPPLY_CLEAR_MARK_NAMES =
  ['font_size', 'font_color']` and routed all three re-press paths through it:
  `clearFontSizeOnNode` → `clearReapplyFormatting` (tag / analytic via
  `computeStructuralReplacement`) now also resets `indent`; `stripIndentAtDepth`
  (pocket / hat / block / undertag) drops its `clearFontSize` option and always
  clears font_size + font_color (so undertag now clears font_size, previously
  omitted); `bulkReapplyStructuralOnShadow` (the right-click select-all-of-style
  path) extended to match (indent + both marks). `spacing` is never touched.
  Replaces the prior inconsistency (tag/analytic kept indent; undertag kept
  font_size; none cleared font_color). The re-press test suite was rewritten to
  assert the full per-style matrix (indent→0, font_size gone, font_color gone,
  spacing preserved).

- **Mod+A no longer selects the whole GUI when focus isn't in a text box**
  (`editor/editable-target.ts` (new), `editor/index.ts`, `editor/home-screen.ts`,
  `tests/editor/editable-target.test.ts`). With nothing editable focused (e.g.
  just alt-tabbed back, no click yet), the browser's default Mod+A selected the
  entire chrome. New shared `editable-target.ts` exports `isEditableTarget`
  (input / textarea / select / contenteditable — `isContentEditable` with an
  attribute fallback for jsdom) and `suppressGuiSelectAll`, registered as a
  capture-phase keydown listener in `index.ts`: plain Mod/Ctrl+A (no Shift/Alt)
  with a non-editable target → `preventDefault`; inside a text box it's a no-op,
  so the ProseMirror editor's and a native input's select-all still apply.
  `home-screen.ts` now imports the shared `isEditableTarget` (dropping its local
  copy). Covered by a jsdom test (the prevent / don't-prevent matrix).

- **Drag-and-drop file opening (desktop)** (`apps/desktop/src/preload.ts`,
  `editor/host/electron-host.ts`, `editor/index.ts`). New `installDragToOpen`
  registers capture-phase `dragover`/`drop` listeners (run in both single-doc and
  multi-pane boot). `dragover` preventDefaults only when the drag carries OS
  `Files` (suppresses Electron's navigate-to-file; never touches internal card
  drags, which carry no `Files` type). `drop` intercepts the first
  `.cmir`/`.cmir-journal`/`.docx`, resolves its path via the new `getPathForFile`
  bridge (`webUtils.getPathForFile` — Electron 32+ removed `File.path`), and
  routes it through the existing `openFileByPath` → `routeOpenedFile`, so dedup,
  the unsaved-changes prompt, and recovery-journal handling are all reused.
  Capture phase + `stopPropagation` so an editor drop is handled here, not by
  ProseMirror; unsupported files fall through untouched. No-op on the web edition
  (no filesystem paths). Verified manually in the dev build — not unit-testable
  (needs real Electron + an OS drag).

- **Add/insert cross-verb aliases on the element-insertion commands**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). Added the missing verb as a per-command alias so
  both phrasings match in command search: `insertTable` ← "add table",
  `addRowBefore`/`addRowAfter`/`addColumnBefore`/`addColumnAfter` (labelled
  "Insert Row/Column …") ← "add row/column …", `insertReceivedAtCursor`/`AtEnd` ←
  "add received card …" (`insertImage` already had "add image"). Deliberately a
  per-command alias, NOT a synonym group — `addQuickCard` / `addCommentToSelection`
  / `addNoteToSelection` CREATE rather than place an element, so "insert" is not
  an equivalent for them.

- **Quick-card ribbon cluster gated behind `showQuickCardButtons` (default off)**
  (`editor/settings.ts`, `editor/index.ts`, `editor/style.css`). New boolean
  setting (interface + default `false` + sanitize + an Editing-category toggle),
  mirroring `showDropzonePill`. The settings-apply subscriber toggles
  `pmd-quickcards-hidden` on `<html>`, and `html.pmd-quickcards-hidden
  #quickcards-stack { display: none }` hides the whole 2×2 cluster — all four
  buttons (`qc-search-btn` / command bar, `qc-tagpicker-btn`, `qc-manage-btn`,
  `qc-add-btn`). Visibility only: the quick-card store, commands, and the command
  bar's `Mod-Shift-Space` shortcut are unaffected.

- **Quick-card delete: two-click confirm replacing native `confirm()`**
  (`editor/quick-cards-manage-ui.ts`, `editor/style.css`). Added a `confirmButton`
  helper mirroring the learn manager's two-click arm pattern (first click →
  `"<label>?"` + `.is-armed`; a second click within 3s runs the action, else it
  disarms). Both delete buttons — per-card (detail footer) and bulk (selection
  bar) — now use it, and the native `confirm()` was removed from `deleteCard` /
  `deleteChecked` (native confirm is disabled in Electron, so the delete
  confirmation was unreliable there). Added a `.pmd-qc-manage-danger.is-armed`
  rule (solid danger fill) matching the learn armed style.

- **Quick-card creation routed through `takeSendSlice`** (`editor/index.ts`).
  `runAddQuickCard` previously took a raw `doc.slice(selection.from, selection.to)`
  after only a non-empty-selection check, so a partial/arbitrary selection
  produced a structurally-broken quick card. It now calls `takeSendSlice(source
  View)` — the same path the send-to dropzone / starred / speech commands use —
  which normalizes an explicit selection to whole structural units (and
  re-highlights it as feedback), or captures the cursor's enclosing card/section
  when the selection is empty; returns null (→ toast) when there's nothing
  structural. No new tests: the normalization is already covered by
  `send-normalize.test.ts`; this is a thin wiring swap.

- **Command-palette synonym groups (data-driven) + a delete/remove group**
  (`editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`, `editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). Replaced the
  hardcoded fix↔repair check in `searchCommandSource`'s `haystack` with a
  data-driven `SYNONYM_GROUPS` table — `[['fix','repair','restore'],
  ['delete','remove']]` — expanded generically: a command whose label contains
  any word in a group gains that group's other words as searchable terms. This
  makes fix/repair/restore fully mutual and adds delete/remove. Trimmed the
  now-redundant cross-verb aliases (`'delete links'` off `removeHyperlinks`,
  `'remove card'` off `deleteCurrentHeading`), and the delete/remove group newly
  covers the alias-less `deleteTableRow`/`Column`/`Table`. Command-search only
  (the settings search still keys on aliases), matching prior scope.

- **Formatting-gap bridging: structural-paragraph exemption + two settings**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`, `editor/settings.ts`, `editor/settings-ui.ts`,
  `tests/editor/formatting-gaps.test.ts`). The gap-fill/bookend bridge — both the
  per-apply `withGapFix` wrapper (8 formatting commands) and the manual
  `fixFormattingGaps` command — now: (1) **skips structural textblocks**
  (`STRUCTURAL_NO_BRIDGE` = tag / analytic / pocket / hat / block / undertag),
  gated **per-textblock** inside `forEachGap` and the manual walk, so a selection
  spanning a structural block and a body paragraph still bridges the body
  paragraph (bridges never cross a paragraph break, so the boundary is never a
  gap); and (2) reads two new **Editing** settings. `formattingGapClass`
  (`'both'` default / `'whitespace'`) drives the gap-char class — `both` →
  `[.,;:?()! ]`, `whitespace` → `[ ]` — consumed by both paths via the
  consolidated `gapCharSet`/`makeGapRegex`/`isGapChar` helpers (this also removes
  the duplicated gap regex that lived in `fixFormattingGaps`). `autoBridgeFormatting`
  Gaps (default true) short-circuits only `withGapFix`; the manual command ignores
  it. UI: a toggle plus a two-option radio labeled "Whitespace and punctuation" /
  "Whitespace only" (`buildFormattingGapClassEditor`, modeled on the saveFormat
  radio). Two existing tests that asserted in-tag bridging were updated to the new
  no-bridge behavior; added per-textblock, gap-class, and auto-toggle coverage.

- **Pasting card content over a range selection no longer breaks the card**
  (`editor/paste-plugin.ts`, `tests/editor/paste-cite-tag-disconnect.test.ts`).
  `tryPasteCardContent` previously bailed on any non-collapsed selection
  (`sel.from !== sel.to → return null`), so pasting fittable content (a
  cite / body / undertag, which serialize as a single OPEN `card` slice) over a
  selection fell through to `tryPasteSplitContainer`; that path saw the open-card
  lead and split the destination card — detaching the tag and spawning a phantom
  empty-tag sibling. The range case now deletes the selection first, then runs
  the existing card-paste matrix at the resulting cursor. `fitBlocks` was
  refactored to operate on a caller-supplied transaction (so the delete and the
  fit are one transaction), and a new `rangeFitsInOneContainer` guard restricts
  in-place fitting to selections that stay within a single card's content slots
  (or all at doc level); a selection crossing into a tag/heading or spanning two
  cards still falls through to the default/split path. A structural lead
  (tag / analytic / heading / whole closed card) still bails before the range
  logic, so it correctly starts a new card. Covered by 7 new range-selection
  tests in the card-paste matrix suite.

- **`analytic` is no longer legal card content; in-card analytics split out into
  their own `analytic_unit`** (`schema/nodes.ts`, `schema/migrate.ts` (new),
  `native/index.ts`, `import/importer.ts`, `editor/paste-plugin.ts`, +tests).
  The card content expression dropped `analytic` — it is now
  `tag (card_body | undertag | cite_paragraph | table)*`. `analytic` was only
  ever an in-card child as the original "cite-slot alternative" (in the schema
  since the foundational commit, surfaced by the importer in the cite-handling
  bundle); it was never a deliberate, documented feature, and it left the
  Backspace/Delete/Enter guards in `tag-keymap.ts` (which key off "is the cursor
  in the container's FIRST child") blind to it — a cite-slot analytic could fold
  into the tag (id lost) or duplicate its id on Enter. An analytic that reaches a
  card — a legacy `.cmir`, or a `.docx` whose author put an Analytic paragraph
  under a tag — is now split out the same way pasting an analytic into a card
  already did (`tryPasteSplitContainer`): the tag + pre-analytic children stay in
  the card, and each analytic heads a trailing `analytic_unit` that absorbs the
  children below it up to the next analytic. The new `splitInCardAnalytics` runs
  in `parseNative` beside `stampMissingHeadingIds`, so every native load (open,
  journal recovery, multi-pane spawn) repairs old files in place —
  `nodeFromJSON` builds the now-invalid node without validating, then the walk
  fixes it before the doc reaches the editor. The importer's "optional in-card
  analytic" special-case was removed so an analytic naturally terminates the card
  and starts its own unit; `fitForCard` coerces a stray analytic to `card_body`
  defensively. Net effect: the cite-slot-analytic boundary bugs are now
  structurally impossible. Covered by new migration tests plus updated
  importer / schema / transform-for-export expectations.

- **Inserts snap to the nearest valid drop target for the kind of content being
  inserted** (`editor/insert-position.ts` (new), `editor/dropzone-ui.ts`,
  `editor/speech-doc-send.ts`, `editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`,
  `editor/settings.ts`, `tests/editor/insert-position.test.ts` (new)). Inserting
  a structural slice — a dropzone shelf item (click-to-insert), a quick card, a
  sent slice — at `selection.head` / `selection.from` forced ProseMirror to
  split the enclosing card to fit it, spawning a phantom blank-tag (`id: null`)
  card for the orphaned tail. New `nearestValidInsertPos(doc, pos, content)`
  mirrors drag-and-drop, where what counts as a drop target depends on what's
  being dropped. Inline text stays at the caret and card content (a cite / body /
  undertag / table) drops INSIDE the enclosing card — both found by walking
  outward to the innermost ancestor that accepts `content` (via
  `Node.canReplace`) and snapping to the nearer surrounding gap. A doc-level
  structural object (`card` / `analytic_unit` / `pocket` / `hat` / `block`)
  instead snaps to the nearest OUTLINE slot for its level, reusing the drag
  surface's own logic (`collectHeadings` + `headingInsertPos` + the same
  `entry.level <= draggedLevel` filter, plus the doc-end slot): a card lands
  between cards, a block between blocks, a hat between hats. None of them split
  the card the caret is in. `dropzone-ui`'s `insertItem` and `speech-doc-send`'s `insertSpeechSlice`
  pass the slice's content to it for a non-blank collapsed caret (an empty
  placeholder line is still filled in place; a range selection still inserts at
  its start). The `insertSpeechSlice` mid-text `window.confirm` and the
  `quickCardSkipMidTextInsertConfirm` setting it gated (interface / default /
  metadata / sanitize) were removed — snapping makes the warning moot. Covered by
  tests for each content kind (card → doc gap, cite → inside the card, inline →
  at the caret) plus an end-to-end check versus the raw-caret split. The same
  snap is applied to the pairing **receive** insert (`pairing/inbox-insert.ts`'s
  `insertReceivedItem`), which had the identical raw-`selection.head` insert, so
  a card received from a partner no longer splits the card the caret is in.

- **Send commands normalize the selection to whole top-level nodes that lead with
  a structural unit** (`editor/send-normalize.ts` (new), `editor/speech-doc-send.ts`,
  `editor/index.ts`, `editor/pairing/send-to-starred.ts`,
  `tests/editor/send-normalize.test.ts` (new)). All three send pipelines
  (dropzone, starred recipient, speech doc) funnel through `resolveSendRange`,
  whose non-empty-selection branch previously returned the raw `{from, to}` — so
  an arbitrary selection (a partial card, a leading loose paragraph) produced a
  slice that couldn't be placed cleanly on receipt (it split a card / spawned a
  phantom). New `normalizeSelectionForSend(doc, from, to)` rounds each endpoint to
  a top-level boundary off the RAW selection (so rounding one endpoint never
  erases what another rule needs): the **end** rounds to nearest; the **start**
  rounds to nearest for a card / analytic_unit, includes-or-skips a heading by
  which half the caret is in (its intro riding along when included), and for a
  leading loose paragraph trims forward to the first structural unit UNLESS > 75%
  of that section's intro text is selected — in which case it grabs the heading +
  the whole intro so the intro travels under a structural lead. Collapsing
  endpoints fall back to the most-overlapped structural unit; a result holding no
  structural unit returns null (nothing sent). This leans on the absorb invariant
  that loose paragraphs only sit at doc-top or right after a heading, so only a
  *leading* loose paragraph is ever a problem. New `takeSendSlice` reflects the
  normalized range back as the source selection (feedback) for an explicit
  selection, leaving a bare cursor's enclosing-structure send untouched. Covered
  by 13 tests across cards, headings, the 75% intro carve-out, and loose paragraphs.

- **Paste that leads with body content then turns structural no longer breaks the
  card** (`editor/paste-plugin.ts`, `tests/editor/paste-body-then-structural.test.ts`
  (new)). A clipboard slice shaped `[body…, heading/card…]` — a paragraph copied
  with a following heading, common via OS copy/paste, which bypasses the (now
  normalized) send pipelines — was caught by neither `tryPasteCardContent` (bails
  on the structural node) nor `tryPasteSplitContainer` (bails on the
  non-structural lead), so it fell to PM's default fitter and split the
  destination card (phantom tag). `tryPasteSplitContainer`'s body was extracted
  into a shared `buildContainerSplit(state, structuralFlat, bodyPrefix)`, and new
  `tryPasteBodyThenStructural` splits the slice at the first structural node,
  requires the prefix to be card-fittable, and runs the split with the body
  prefix merged into the pre-cursor content (`mergeBodyPrefix`: the first body
  paragraph merges inline, subsequent paragraphs become their own `card_body`
  blocks, a cite/undertag lands as its own block). `handlePaste` tries it after
  the structural-led split — on the reparsed flat, doc-level slice (falling back
  to the raw slice). The result mirrors the structural-led split with the body
  folded in: the leading body joins the cursor's card, the structural content
  starts its own container, and the post-cursor tail rides under the last pasted
  node. Covered by 7 tests (paragraph + heading / whole card / bare tag,
  body-start, multi-paragraph prefix, cite-in-prefix, bail cases).

- **Loose tables after a card / analytic_unit are now absorbed into it**
  (`editor/absorb-plugin.ts`, `tests/editor/absorb.test.ts`). The absorb plugin
  pulled loose `paragraph` / `cite_paragraph` / `undertag` / `card_body` siblings
  into a preceding `card` / `analytic_unit` but STOPPED at a `table`, so tagging
  a run of content that included a table (F7 on the lead line, then absorb)
  produced a card that ended at the table — the table and everything after it
  stranded at doc level. `table` is valid content of both `card` and
  `analytic_unit` (the importer already nests inline tables in cards), so it's
  now in the absorbable set in both `findAbsorbRegions` (the live plugin path)
  and `absorbedDocChildren`, passed through unchanged like cite / undertag /
  card_body. (Images need no handling — they're inline atoms inside a textblock,
  so they absorb along with their paragraph.) Covered by 4 tests: table after a
  card, table doesn't break the zone, table after an analytic_unit, and the live
  plugin path.

- **`liftSurvivorToDocLevel` downcasts a lifted `card_body` to `paragraph`**
  (`editor/tag-keymap.ts`, `tests/editor/tag-keymap.test.ts`). When a blank-tag
  card is dissolved (Backspace/Delete at the blank head) and its survivors lift
  to doc level with no card before them, a `card_body` was lifted unchanged,
  leaving card-body-styled text orphaned at the doc root. It now downcasts to a
  plain `paragraph`. `cite_paragraph` / `undertag` are valid, meaningful
  doc-level nodes and pass through unchanged (deliberately *not* matching
  `liftCardChild`, which downcasts cites — here there's no reason to strip the
  cite typing); `analytic` is still wrapped in an `analytic_unit`.

- **Repair-paragraph indent-on-exit is clamped to the workflow's card**
  (`editor/repair-paragraph-plugin.ts`, `tests/editor/repair-paragraph.test.ts`).
  `buildExitTransaction` indents each designated paragraph; because designated
  positions are mapped forward through every edit, one could in principle drift
  across a card boundary and indent a paragraph in a neighboring card (indent
  attr only — not a structural break). It now skips any designated textblock that
  resolves outside the current `cardRange`, so the deferred indent can only ever
  land inside the card the workflow opened on. Covered by a test that a
  designated position planted in another card is left untouched on exit.

- **Voice "new card" mints a real tag id** (`editor/voice/dispatch.ts`,
  `tests/editor/voice-new-card.test.ts`). The `newCard` voice command built its
  card with `card.createAndFill()`, which fills the required tag from attr
  defaults (`id: null`) — an id-less heading is invisible to the nav pane / level
  filter and the cursor→nav highlight falls back to the previous card
  (`schema/ids.ts`). Extracted `newCardNode(schema)`, which builds the card with
  a tag carrying a fresh `newHeadingId()`, and the command now uses it; other
  card-creating paths (ribbon F7) already stamp ids, so this brings voice in
  line. (Load-time `stampMissingHeadingIds` would have repaired it on the next
  reload, but the card was nav-invisible until then.)

- **Home-screen 1–9 shortcuts stand down under a modal or a focused input**
  (`editor/home-screen.ts`, `editor/overlay-stack.ts`,
  `tests/editor/home-screen-shortcuts.test.ts`,
  `tests/editor/overlay-stack.test.ts`). The home screen's document-level keydown
  handler fired its number (and Escape) shortcuts unconditionally, so with a
  dialog or the command bar layered over it the shortcut ran AND swallowed number
  input meant for the modal. `onKeyDown` now bails when `isAnyOverlayOpen()` (new
  export on the shared overlay stack — settings / quick-card / learn dialogs all
  push to it) or when the keydown target is a text-entry element
  (`isEditableTarget`, which covers the command bar's focused search field and any
  dialog input). Covered by a jsdom test (fires when home is the active layer,
  suppressed under an overlay or with a focused input, resumes once the overlay
  closes) plus an `isAnyOverlayOpen` unit test.

- **The AI edit coordinator blocks length-neutral edits (marks / styles / attrs)
  inside a live lease** (`editor/ai/edit-coordinator.ts`,
  `tests/editor/edit-coordinator.test.ts`). `leaseTouched` only detected
  content-length changes and boundary deletions, so an add/remove-mark or style
  application inside a lease — which produces identity step maps (no length
  change) — slipped through and was applied mid-operation. After the
  length/boundary fast paths, it now compares the region's slice before vs after
  (`tr.before.slice(from, to).eq(tr.doc.slice(f, t))`) and blocks any
  difference — inline marks, node attrs, or same-length text. Edits *outside* the
  lease still only remap it (the region's content is unchanged, so the slices
  compare equal), preserving concurrent disjoint ops. Covered by a test that
  add/remove of a mark inside a lease is blocked while the same mark outside is
  allowed.

- **Non-glyph-changing decorations split ligatures at formatting boundaries**
  (`editor/style.css`). Highlight / shading (background) and underline / emphasis
  (text-decoration) render as mark spans, and the browser shapes a ligature
  *across* such span boundaries — background and text-decoration aren't
  shaping-relevant, so the run isn't broken there — so applying one to part of a
  ligature painted the whole joined glyph. Adding `font-variant-ligatures: none`
  to `.pmd-highlight`, `[data-shading]`, `.pmd-underline`, `.pmd-emphasis` is a
  shaping-relevant difference, so the run breaks at the mark boundary: the
  ligature splits and each character is decorated on its own. Trade-off: a
  ligature wholly inside one uniform decoration also un-ligates (CSS targets the
  whole span, not just its edges), so highlighted / underlined text doesn't form
  ligatures at all. Bold / italic / cite already break shaping (they change the
  glyph). Text color and cite-when-not-bold have the same class of issue but were
  left out of scope. CSS-only — verified visually in the dev build, not the test
  suite (jsdom can't shape fonts).

## 0.1.0-beta.2 — 2026-06-25

- **Rebindable single-press doc-cycle commands for three-pane mode**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`, `editor/ribbon-groups.ts`,
  `editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`, `editor/index.ts`). Added two `RibbonCommandId`s,
  `cycleDocNext` / `cycleDocPrev` (labels "Next / Previous Document in Slot",
  default keys `''` → unbound + rebindable), in the "Multi-pane workspace" group.
  They dispatch via `runViewlessRibbon` → `runMultiPaneCycle(±1)` → the new module
  export `cycleFocusedSlotDoc`, which calls `MultiPaneShell.cycleFocusedSlotDoc`:
  it instantly switches the focused slot's visible doc one step through the stack
  (from `visibleIndex`, wrapping) via `slot.showRecord`, with no Alt+Tab overlay.
  The existing hold-to-preview Ctrl-Tab (`onDocCycleKey`, a raw window listener)
  is untouched. Every `RibbonCommandId` exhaustive switch + the group drift guard
  required adding the ids in each place.

- **`one` / `two` / `three` aliased to the slot commands**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). Added spelled-out-number aliases to
  `RIBBON_COMMAND_ALIASES` for `focusSlot1-3` / `sendDocToSlot1-3`, which the
  command-bar search (`quick-card-search-ui.ts`, which folds aliases into each
  command's search haystack) now matches by word.

- **Auto-update: renamed the setting and added a daily background check**
  (`editor/settings-ui.ts`, `editor/index.ts`). The toggle "Check for updates on
  launch" is renamed "Check for updates automatically." Alongside the existing
  at-launch trigger (first window only — `triggerAutoUpdateCheck` →
  `runUpdateCheck({ alertOnLatest: false, alertOnError: false })`), the boot path
  now also arms a 24h `setInterval` (first window only) that re-fires the same
  silent check, re-reading `checkForUpdatesOnLaunch` each tick so toggling it off
  stops the checks. Both paths stay silent unless an update is found. The setting
  key (`checkForUpdatesOnLaunch`) is unchanged, so there's no settings migration.

- **Bundle metric-compatible open-source substitutes for the proprietary / system
  fonts the picker offers** (`editor/style.css`, `editor/font-detect.ts`,
  `editor/fonts/`). The picker listed Calibri / Cambria / Times New Roman / Arial /
  Georgia / Helvetica / Comic Sans MS / Verdana / Tahoma / Liberation / DejaVu /
  Noto but shipped none of them, so a user without the font got a generic fallback.
  Added latin-subset woff2 (regular / bold / italic / bold-italic) for Carlito
  (→Calibri), Caladea (→Cambria), Tinos (→Times New Roman / Liberation Serif),
  Arimo (→Arial / Helvetica / Liberation Sans), Gelasio (→Georgia), Comic Neue
  (→Comic Sans MS), DejaVu Sans (→Verdana / Tahoma), DejaVu Serif, and Noto
  Sans / Serif — 40 files, fetched from the Fontsource CDN. Each is declared in
  `@font-face` under the PROPRIETARY family name, `src` listing **style-specific**
  `local()` faces first (`local('Times New Roman Bold')` for the 700 face, with
  `Oblique` aliases for the italic faces) then the bundled `url()` — so a user's
  real font, including its true bold/italic, still wins, and the clone is fetched
  only when the real font is absent. All families added to `BUNDLED_FONTS` in
  `font-detect.ts` so they show in the picker unconditionally. Licenses (OFL 1.1 /
  Apache 2.0 / DejaVu-Bitstream Vera) are documented in `fonts/LICENSES.md`, with
  the full Apache and DejaVu texts saved as `Apache-2.0.txt` / `DejaVu-License.txt`.

- **Doc loading sniffs the bytes for the parser instead of trusting the `format`
  field** (`editor/index.ts`, `editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`). A doc's `format`
  (`'cmir'` / `'docx'`) is its SAVE format, but the in-memory + journal
  serialization is ALWAYS `serializeNative` (native cmir) regardless of format —
  so a docx-saved doc's journal / mode-switch payload carries native cmir bytes
  stamped `format: 'docx'`. The paths that load already-obtained bytes
  (`routeOpenedFile`, `loadFileInPlace`, `mountFromSpawnPayload`, and multi-pane
  `loadOpenedIntoSlot`) branched on `format` to pick the parser, so those cmir
  bytes were sent to `fromDocxFull` (JSZip) → "Can't find end of central
  directory". This silently dropped docx-saved docs on every three-pane toggle
  (the mode-switch respawns through `mountFromSpawnPayload`) and broke opening a
  docx-saved doc's `.cmir-journal`. Fix: a `bytesLookLikeDocx` sniff (a `.docx`
  is a `PK` zip — `0x50 0x4b`; native cmir is gzipped or raw JSON and never is)
  chooses the parser at all four sites, while `format` still drives saving (a
  docx doc re-saves as docx). The crash-recovery loaders (`applyRecovery`, the
  auto-recovery paths, and the recovery reserializer) were already correct — they
  hardcode `parseNative` on the always-cmir journal bytes — so they're unchanged.

- **Open `.cmir-journal` files directly via File → Open** (`editor/index.ts`). A
  `.cmir-journal` is the crash-recovery envelope (`{ uid, filename, handle,
  format, savedAt, bytesB64 }`) wrapping the same doc bytes a `.cmir` holds. Added
  `cmir-journal` to `OPEN_FILE_FILTERS` and a shared `resolveOpenedFile(opened)`
  that, for a `.cmir-journal`, JSON-parses the envelope, base64-decodes `bytesB64`
  to the real doc bytes, and returns `{ name, bytes, handle: null, format,
  recovered: true }` — opening the wrapped doc as a RECOVERED, unsaved copy:
  `handle` is null so Save can't clobber the original (which may be newer or live
  on another machine), it mounts dirty (`markCurrentDocDirty`), and it isn't
  recorded as a recent (the Save flow records it once written). Format comes from
  the envelope (`cmir`→`parseNative`, `docx`→`fromDocxFull`), not assumed `cmir`
  like the crash-recovery path. Both `routeOpenedFile` (ribbon / Ctrl-O Open +
  command-palette file search) and `pickAndLoadInPlace` (home-screen Open) route
  through `resolveOpenedFile`, so the Open dialog, home-screen Open, and the web
  build (same extension-based dispatch) all get it for free; the resolved name
  carries the format's extension so multi-pane (which re-derives format from the
  name) agrees. Plain `.cmir` / `.docx` pass through unchanged. Finder
  double-click / OS file-association was intentionally left out of scope.

- **Tooltips are custom-rendered instead of native `title`** (`editor/ribbon-tooltips.ts`,
  `editor/style.css`, `index.html`, `editor/nav-panel.ts`). The ribbon tooltip
  controller set `el.title = …`; Electron/Chromium on macOS renders native `title`
  tooltips erratically (long, inconsistent trigger delay, flicker, frequently
  swallowed), so the desktop build's tooltips were slow / missing while the same
  attributes were fine in the web build's real browser. Replaced `el.title` with a
  small custom renderer: one shared `.pmd-ribbon-tooltip` element, delegated
  `pointerover` / `pointerout` (so dynamically added/removed targets need no
  per-element listeners), a ~450 ms hover delay, positioned under the target
  (flips above / clamps to the viewport), hidden on `pointerdown` / scroll / blur.
  Icon buttons get an `aria-label` so screen readers keep a name (and there's no
  double-tooltip, since `title` is gone). Because most of the app sets `title`
  directly and bypasses the controller (find/replace, comments, dropzone, command
  bar, speech controls, …), the controller also ADOPTS any native `title` on first
  hover — moving the text into the same renderer and stripping the flaky attribute
  — except inside the contenteditable document, so it doesn't fight ProseMirror's
  DOM. `reapplyAllRibbonTooltips()` still tracks `ribbonTooltipMode` / rebinds.
  Two related tweaks rode along: the command-bar button's tooltip was relabeled
  `Search quick cards` → `Toggle command bar` (`index.html`), and the redundant
  per-row type-label `title` on nav-pane outline entries (`nav-panel.ts`) was
  dropped.

- **Pasting card content fits INTO the card instead of splitting it — new
  `tryPasteCardContent` matrix** (`editor/paste-plugin.ts`,
  `tests/editor/paste-cite-tag-disconnect.test.ts`). A cite / body / undertag
  copied from inside a card serializes to the clipboard as a single OPEN `card`
  (`openStart` 2, its required `tag` cut off by the openness). On paste,
  `handlePaste`'s structural path (`tryPasteSplitContainer`) saw the leading
  `card` and SPLIT the destination card to insert it, detaching the tag into its
  own empty-bodied card — un-selectable, un-draggable, the gray `.pmd-card` rail
  no longer reaching the tag. An interim inline-merge attempt then over-corrected,
  flattening pasted cites into plain `card_body` text (silent data loss — a
  `cite_paragraph` is only subtly styled, so it was easy to miss). Replaced both
  with `tryPasteCardContent`, run BEFORE the split path: it unwraps a leading open
  `card` / `analytic_unit` and fits the carried blocks into the cursor's card per
  an agreed matrix that never breaks the card and preserves block types —
  - body (`card_body` / `paragraph`) into a `card_body` / `cite_paragraph` → absorbed inline;
  - a same-type paste (cite→cite, undertag→undertag) → merges inline;
  - otherwise the block inserts as its OWN type, splitting the cursor's block and
    coalescing empty edges (cite → card_body becomes a real cite line; body →
    undertag splits the undertag with a `card_body` between the halves);
  - an EMPTY target block is overwritten (filled), not split;
  - OUTSIDE a card the blocks drop in loose with body → `paragraph` (no more
    phantom empty-tag card), and the cursor lands at the END of the pasted run —
    matching the in-card / F2 paste paths instead of stranding it behind an empty
    line.
  A `tag` / `analytic` / heading / whole closed `card` lead still bails to the
  split path (those SHOULD start a new card). `tryPasteAsCardBodies` is restored
  to its narrow role as the F2 plain-text helper. Locked by 17 matrix-cell tests.

- **Plain reload keeps its menu item but drops the Cmd/Ctrl+R accelerator**
  (`apps/desktop/src/main.ts`). `buildMenu`'s View menu used `{ role: 'reload' }`,
  which auto-binds CmdOrCtrl+R — a stray Cmd-R mid-edit reloaded the renderer and
  read like a crash / data loss. Replaced it with a plain
  `{ label: 'Reload', click: () => BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()?.webContents.reload() }`
  (no accelerator), so the menu entry stays but the hotkey is gone;
  `{ role: 'forceReload' }` (Cmd-Shift-R) is untouched. The menu is the only
  source of the reload accelerator (Windows/Linux already run menu-less, so Ctrl+R
  was unbound there), so dropping it from the role is sufficient — no
  `before-input-event` needed.

- **Web "Layout on this device" options use the shared radio styling**
  (`editor/settings-ui.ts`). `buildMobileLayoutEditor` set
  `pmd-mobile-layout-{editor,row,row-label}` classes that were never defined in
  `style.css`, so the `webOnly` `mobileLayout` radios rendered unstyled (no column
  layout, gap, or matching font). Repointed them at the shared `pmd-heading-mode-*`
  classes used by the other radio editors (Heading Mode, the card-cutter radios) —
  the DOM is identical, so they now match exactly. The radio `groupName` keeps its
  own value (it's the input `name` attribute, not a CSS class).

## 0.1.0-beta.1 — 2026-06-24

- **Right-click a file search result dives in instead of pinning**
  (`editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`). In the Search Everything palette, a
  file row's context menu used to toggle the pin — redundant with the ★ star
  sitting right on the row (and the **Alt-P** shortcut). Right-click now
  selects that row and calls the same `enterInFile()` path **Tab** uses,
  diving into the file to search its objects. The star and `Alt-P` still pin;
  the outline rows' right-click (toggle-collapse) is unchanged.

- **Escape steps out of a dived-into file regardless of focus**
  (`editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`). The palette's keydown handler was bound
  only to the search input, so once focus left the box (clicking or scrolling
  the results) Escape went unheard and the user was stranded in the file view.
  Added a document-level Escape fallback that fires whenever the palette is
  open — guarded against double-handling so a focused Escape (owned by the
  input's handler) doesn't both step back *and* close. Stepping back also
  re-focuses the search box.

- **Clod customizer surfaced as a real setting** (`editor/settings.ts`,
  `editor/settings-ui.ts`, `editor/mobile-settings-ui.ts`). The configurator
  (persona name + pronouns, the activity pools per time period, the time-period
  boundaries) was reachable only via a deliberately obscure Mod+Alt+Shift+click
  on the **Enable Clod mode** toggle. Replaced that easter egg with a plain
  toggle plus a new **Customize Clod** setting row (new `clodCustomize` kind — a
  button that opens the same `openClodConfigurator()` dialog), placed right
  after the toggle and gated on `aiFeaturesEnabled` like the rest of the AI
  settings. Desktop-only; mobile keeps just the toggle.

- **Multi-pane gets the same bottom-pill runway as single-pane**
  (`editor/index.ts`, `editor/style.css`). The single-doc editor pads
  `#editor .ProseMirror` with `padding-bottom: 4.5rem` so the bottom pill tray
  (dropzone / send / receive) doesn't overlap the last lines — but that rule is
  gated `body:not(.pmd-multi-doc)`, and the multi-pane equivalent was never
  actually built (a `positionDropzone` comment pointed at a
  `.pmd-dropzone-runway-spacer` that exists only as a mobile hide-rule). The tray
  anchors to the leftmost visible pane, so `positionDropzone` now tags that pane
  `pmd-pane-pill-anchored` (moving the class as the anchor changes), and a mirror
  CSS rule gives only that pane's editor the same 4.5rem runway. Other panes stay
  flush; gated on pill-hidden like single-pane. The stale comment is corrected.

- **Highlight / shading / font-size no longer rewrite the underline / emphasis /
  cite of adjacent gaps** (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). `applyFullGapTarget`'s
  `appliesNamedStyle = false` branch normalized the named-style family from the
  gap's bookends even though the command that ran never touched it — so for
  `<E> <underlined join> <E>`, highlighting either emphasized side saw emphasis on
  both bookends and overwrote the deliberate underlined read-aloud join with
  emphasis. The whole named-style normalization is now gated on
  `appliesNamedStyle`; an unrelated command leaves underline / emphasis / cite
  completely untouched and only tidies its own family. This also subsumes the
  earlier "don't break emphasis on a continuous phrase" fix (now it's just "don't
  touch it"). Regression test added in `formatting-gaps.test.ts`.

- **Hyphens are exempt from gap filling, like the other dashes/operators**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). The gap normalizer's fillable-gap-char set
  (`GAP_REGEX` / `GAP_CHAR_RE`, plus the duplicate inside `fixFormattingGaps`) is
  a deliberate allowlist — `.,;:?()!` and space — so em-dash, en-dash, `=`, and
  `+` already break gaps rather than getting bridged/stripped. The hyphen was the
  lone dash that had slipped into the list, so underlining/emphasizing/citing two
  hyphen-joined words (`well-known`) pulled the hyphen into the run. Removed `\-`
  from all four copies of the char-class and documented the allowlist so it isn't
  re-added. Regression tests (hyphen + em-dash) in `formatting-gaps.test.ts`.

- **Importer promotes outline-leveled "Normal" paragraphs to their structural
  node** (`import/importer.ts`). Tags/headings authored as plain Normal text with
  only a direct `<w:outlineLvl>` (no Heading style) imported as flat paragraphs —
  `resolveNodeType` keyed entirely off `pStyle`, so a style-less paragraph
  short-circuited to `paragraph` and the outline level was never consulted. Added
  `outlineHeadingNode`, a mirror of the style cleaner's first-pass header
  detection (`ooxml/style-clean/style-cleaner.ts`): when style-based
  classification yields `paragraph`, an effective outline level of 0–3 plus the
  matching run formatting promotes it — `0`+bold+26pt → pocket, `1`+bold+22pt →
  hat, `2`+bold+underline+16pt → block, `3`+bold → tag. The formatting conjuncts
  are the cleaner's guardrails, so an ordinary outline-leveled Word doc isn't
  mis-structured. Verified on real send docs (one went from 0 detected tags / 94
  loose paragraphs to 11 tags + 7 blocks + 11 cards; another from 2 tags to 27).
  Tests in `import/importer.test.ts`. Outline level and bold are resolved through
  each style's `basedOn` chain — once, in `parseStyles` (`StyleInfo` now carries
  the effective `outlineLevel` + `bold`) — and the tag uses the cleaner's
  `effectivelyBold` (direct run bold, else the run's char style or the paragraph
  style), so a heading/tag that is one only through an inherited style is caught
  too. The chain walk is once-per-style, never per-paragraph, so the per-paragraph
  classification stays a plain property read with an early-out on no outline
  level — the fast path for body text is unchanged.

- **Find: O(log N) navigation, match/row caps, scroll coalescing, and
  analytic/undertag categories** (`editor/find-replace-plugin.ts`,
  `editor/find-replace-ui.ts`, `editor/precise-scroll.ts`, `editor/settings.ts`,
  `editor/settings-ui.ts`, `editor/style.css`). Three things scaled with match
  count on every navigation step; all three are now split so only the active
  marker moves:
  - The match decoration set was rebuilt from scratch each step (the memo was
    keyed on `currentIndex`). Split into a base set — all matches with
    `pmd-find-match`, cached on (doc, matches, scope) — plus a single current-match
    overlay layered on via `.add` keyed on `currentIndex`, so a step is O(log N).
  - The in-context results list re-`innerHTML`'d and rebuilt a row + a `buildSnippet`
    per match each step; now built once per search (cached on the `matches` ref),
    with only the active row's `data-active` toggled on navigation.
  - The nav-pane hit markers re-mapped `matches.map(m => m.from)` and re-rendered
    each step; now skipped when the match list is unchanged.
  Caps: `FIND_MATCH_CAP` (10 000) bounds the match/decoration set on a pathological
  query (the count shows `10000+`); the results list renders the first
  `FIND_RESULT_ROW_CAP` (500) rows with a "refine to narrow" footer.
  `preciseScrollIntoView` carries a generation token so a newer scroll cancels an
  older one's rAF refine loop — holding "next match" no longer stacks materialize
  passes. Separately, standalone `analytic` and `undertag` paragraphs are now
  their own find categories (were lumped into `other`), ordered after `tag`
  (analytic → undertag → cite), badge-colored to match the editor's analytic/
  undertag colors and reorderable in Settings → Find; the `findCategoryOrder`
  sanitizer slots a newly-added category into an existing saved order at its
  canonical position rather than appending it.

- **Command-bar file pre-warm starts at boot instead of on first idle**
  (`editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`). `prewarmQuickCardFiles` already warmed both
  the file LIST (`listCmirFiles` → main's `cmirIndexMem`) and the pinned-file
  CONTENT parse (`runWarmPass` → `warmCache`), but the whole thing was wrapped in
  `scheduleIdle(…, 2000)` — so neither started until the renderer first went idle
  (≤2s post-launch), and a command-bar open in that window still raced a
  not-yet-started warm. Split it: the per-root `listCmirFiles` calls now fire
  synchronously at boot — they're just async IPC, and the recursive walk /
  disk-index load runs in the main process, so they don't compete with the
  renderer's launch render — while the renderer-CPU pin parse (`runWarmPass`)
  stays on the idle delay. The file index is now building from t≈0, so a search
  opened a second after launch hits a warm cache instead of a cold scan.

## 0.1.0-alpha.20 — 2026-06-23

- **No native menu bar on Windows/Linux — Alt-key editor shortcuts now work**
  (`apps/desktop/src/main.ts`, `editor/settings-ui.ts`, `editor/style.css`). On
  Windows/Linux the native application menu reserved `Alt`+`<key>` for mnemonics,
  swallowing any editor command bound to a bare-Alt chord (Alt without Mod) before
  it reached the keymap — a rebind of "create analytic" to `Alt+A` did nothing,
  as did defaults like `selectCurrentHeading`'s `Alt-A`. An initial fix that
  forwarded those bindings through focus-scoped `globalShortcut`s was scrapped: a
  global shortcut grabs the chord at the OS level, so it can never be *captured*
  in the keybindings editor, making such bindings impossible to set or change.
  Instead the native menu is now installed on **macOS only**
  (`setApplicationMenu(process.platform === 'darwin' ? buildMenu() : null)` at
  both call sites), where Option doesn't trigger mnemonics and the global menu bar
  is expected. Every menu command's accelerator is already a renderer keybinding
  (handled by the editor keymap + the editor-unfocused global handler), so
  dropping the bar loses no shortcut; Cut/Copy/Paste/Undo work natively in the
  contenteditable. To keep the manual reachable without the menu, a **User Manual**
  link (`buildManualLinkSection`, opened via `openExternal`) is pinned at the
  bottom of Settings → General. Also removed the obsolete **Copy GPU Info**
  Help-menu item.

- **Benchmark — an in-app, game-style performance suite** (`editor/benchmark.ts`,
  `editor/benchmark-ui.ts`, `editor/benchmark-sample.ts`; surfaced via
  `buildBenchmarkSection` in `editor/settings-ui.ts`; wired through
  `beginBenchmark`/`endBenchmark` in `editor/index.ts`). A button in
  Settings → General runs a battery of real in-editor operations on the open
  document and reports rendering performance as a scrollable readout with a
  scroll-frame-time graph, footnoted metrics, and a single composite score.
  Tests: a continuous top→bottom scroll sampling each frame's interval (mean fps,
  p50/p95/p99 frame time, a 1%-low derived from p99, jank-frame count); nav jumps
  to headings spread across the doc via the same `preciseScrollIntoView` the nav
  pane uses (median + p90 click→settled); a forced relayout; a long-task tally via
  `PerformanceObserver`; and a scripted card-cutting sequence that builds a card
  the way a debater does — new heading + tag, then a real cite line that becomes
  the cite only once the cite mark is applied to its author/short-cite, then a
  paste of a real multi-paragraph card from the corpus **with extra blank lines
  between paragraphs**, a condense to drop the blanks and make it "cutting ready",
  and underline/emphasis/highlight sweeps (reported as the **average time per mark
  application**, since totals only track card length) plus a Smart Shrink. It is
  self-instrumented via `requestAnimationFrame` + `PerformanceObserver` — it
  measures CardMirror's own renderer, not a cross-application comparison.
  Implementation notes: the run executes against a `view.updateState` snapshot
  with a `benchmarkActive` flag that suppresses autosave / dirty-tracking / nav
  rebuilds, and the document is reverted to that snapshot when the user **closes**
  the results (by any path, once-guarded), so a benchmark never touches the file
  or the undo history. The cut spans are re-derived per paragraph from the
  post-condense document by sequential text match, so they survive condense's
  whitespace cleanup. The benchmark no-ops in read mode (it edits the document,
  which read mode locks). The fixture is auto-extracted into `benchmark-sample.ts`
  and guarded by `tests/editor/benchmark-sample.test.ts`.

- **Keyboard shortcuts to insert the most-recently-received card**
  (`editor/pairing/inbox-insert.ts` new; `editor/ribbon-commands.ts`,
  `editor/ribbon-groups.ts`, `editor/index.ts`; `editor/pairing/receive-pill-ui.ts`
  refactored). Two new rebindable ribbon commands — `insertReceivedAtCursor`
  (default **Mod-P**) and `insertReceivedAtEnd` (default **Mod-Alt-P**) — grab the
  last item in the inbox (`inboxStore.list().at(-1)`, which is newest-last) and
  insert it at the selection head or at `doc.content.size`. The pill's click /
  drag-out insert and the two shortcuts now share one helper,
  `insertReceivedItem(view, item, atEnd)` in the new `inbox-insert.ts` (heading-id
  rewrite so ids can't collide, read-mode-tagged dispatch, scroll-into-view; the
  item is left in the inbox, since insertion isn't consumption). Registered
  through the `RibbonCommandId` system, so they auto-appear in the keybindings
  editor with automatic conflict detection; their keybindings group is merged
  with the existing Send-to-Dropzone command under one section,
  "Dropzone / Send and Receive Cards".

- **"Send to Starred" — a one-key send to a starred recipient/group**
  (`editor/pairing/send-to-starred.ts` new; `editor/settings.ts`,
  `editor/settings-ui.ts`, `editor/ribbon-commands.ts`, `editor/ribbon-groups.ts`,
  `editor/index.ts`, `editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`, `editor/style.css`). A new
  single-valued setting `pairingStarred` (`{ kind: 'partner' | 'group'; ref } |
  null`) holds the one starred target. Star toggles on every recipient and group
  row in Card Sharing set it; because it's a single value, starring one inherently
  un-stars the rest, and both editors re-render off the shared `settings.subscribe`
  so the star moves visibly — exactly-one is enforced by the data model, not the
  UI. `sanitizePairingStarred` clears the ref when its recipient/group no longer
  exists. The new rebindable ribbon command `sendToStarred` (ships unbound)
  resolves the ref to recipient codes (partner → its code; group → its members,
  re-filtered against current partners) and sends the cursor's card — sourced
  exactly like Send to Dropzone via `resolveSendSlice` — through
  `relayClient.send`, building the same `{ label, type, sliceJson }` payload as the
  Send pill. It silently no-ops when nothing is starred, and toasts only on
  sharing-off / empty-group / send result. Wired through the `multiDocSendToStarred`
  hook for both single-doc and multi-pane, and grouped with the other send/receive
  commands in the keybindings editor.

- **Clean — optional in-place overwrite, gated behind a typed confirmation**
  (`editor/clean-ui.ts`, `editor/style.css`). Clean previously hard-coded a
  `cleaned_` prefix on every output (single-file `cleaned_${name}`, bulk
  `cleanedRel`). A new `prepend` toggle (a per-session field, on by default — so
  the safe behavior is the default each time the modal opens) selects between the
  `cleaned_` copy and the original filename. With `prepend` off and the
  destination resolving to the source's own folder, the output path equals an
  input path, i.e. an in-place overwrite. `wouldOverwriteInPlace()` detects this
  — off **and** `normPath(outputDir ?? sourceRoot) === normPath(sourceRoot)`,
  covering both the default (no destination) and an explicitly-chosen
  same-as-source folder. The Clean button now routes through `onCleanClick`,
  which, when an overwrite is staged, awaits `confirmOverwrite()` — a stacked
  sub-modal (same `pushSubOverlay` mechanism as the protected-styles editor)
  whose Confirm Overwrite button stays disabled until the user types the exact
  phrase "I accept the risk"; Cancel / Escape / click-out resolve false and abort.
  The output-path line shows a live red overwrite hint so the consequence is
  visible before clicking. Prepending always writes new files; a different
  destination writes copies — neither warns. (The phrase input and button row
  reuse `.pmd-clean-prot-input` / `.pmd-bulk-actions`, scoped-overridden because
  the dialog body is a flex column, not the row those classes assume.)

- **Clean — robustness on a full-library bulk run** (`apps/desktop/src/main.ts`,
  `ooxml/style-clean/legacy-remap.ts`, `ooxml/style-clean/style-cleaner.ts`,
  `editor/clean-ui.ts`). Cleaning an entire file library surfaced three failure
  modes. (1) The recursive `.docx` walk (`host:list-files-recursive`) picked up
  Word lock/owner files (`~$…`), macOS AppleDouble sidecars (`._…`), and
  `__MACOSX` folders — none are real documents, and each failed JSZip's
  end-of-central-directory check; they're now skipped in the walk. (2)
  `no style with id or name 'Heading5'`: `legacy-remap` injects the canonical
  set before assigning, but it tops out at Heading4, while the *shared*
  `buildLegacyHeadingMap` can yield level 5 (the importer maps `Heading5→block`).
  The cleaner's `headingIdFor` now caps at `Heading4` — its deepest injectable
  heading — leaving the shared map untouched for the importer. (3)
  `no style with id or name 'Heading1'/'Heading4'`: the header-detection pass
  assigns these, but the canonical set is only injected when the *required*
  styles (`Style13ptBold`/`StyleUnderline`/`Emphasis`) are missing, so a doc that
  had the required styles but lacked a `HeadingN` threw on assignment —
  python-docx treats built-in headings as always-available, our `Styles.get`
  shim doesn't. A new `ensureHeadingStyle` injects the canonical set on demand
  (idempotent) right before the lookup. Finally, the bulk runner classifies an
  unreadable-zip error (empty / truncated / non-document) as **skipped (not a
  valid .docx)** rather than a cleaning **failure**, so a few corrupt cloud
  conflict-copies don't inflate the failure count. The byte-for-byte parity
  suite against the Python reference still passes.

## 0.1.0-alpha.19 — 2026-06-22

- **Clean — a client-side `.docx` style cleaner** (`ooxml/style-clean/style-cleaner.ts`,
  `ooxml/style-clean/ooxml-doc.ts`, `ooxml/style-clean/template-styles.ts`,
  `ooxml/style-clean/style-fixup.ts`, `editor/clean-ui.ts`, `editor/home-screen.ts`).
  A faithful TypeScript port of the scouting-assistant `style_cleaner.py`, running
  entirely in the renderer over a small python-docx-equivalent shim
  (`OoxmlDoc`/`Styles`/`Style`/`Paragraph`/`Run`) on the JSZip `Docx` layer.
  Pipeline: normalize style aliases → convert direct formatting to semantic styles
  (cite/underline/emphasis run classification; heading detection by effective
  outline level + bold resolved through the `basedOn` chain; case-insensitive
  Analytic matching) → rename/remove to the canonical Verbatim set
  (`COMBINED_STYLE_MAP`) → strip hyperlinks → repair dangling style refs. Validated
  byte-identical to the Python reference on clean files. Engine work beyond the
  port: a Chromium-only double-`<?xml?>`-declaration bug — the `XMLSerializer`
  emits the declaration itself, so prepending a second one broke the re-parse and
  silently yielded zero styles — fixed in `serializeXmlDoc`; O(1) style lookups via
  a lazily-built id/name index (the Python's O(styles × runs) scans timed out on
  3,786-style merged docs); and removal of the prune passes (the canonical
  reduction already covers them, and with O(1) lookups they gave no speedup —
  `style-pruner.ts` became `style-fixup.ts`, keeping only the dangling-ref repair).
  The Home-screen UI cleans a file or a recursed folder, defaults the destination
  to each source's own folder (writing `cleaned_…`), shows a per-file progress bar,
  and exposes **protected styles** (never removed/reassigned, their `basedOn`/`link`
  dependencies kept) behind a gear that opens a separate modal.

- **Injecting + repairing required styles so more docs clean** (`ooxml/style-clean/style-cleaner.ts`,
  `ooxml/style-clean/ooxml-doc.ts`). When a document lacks the required Verbatim
  styles, `OoxmlDoc.injectMissingStyles` imports the canonical definitions before
  cleaning (gated on `requiredStylesMissing`, so styled docs are untouched, and
  invalidating the style index so the additions resolve). A separate
  `normalizeRequiredStyleNames` pass runs *before* the availability check to repair
  styles present under the canonical styleId but an unrecognized name — e.g. a
  Verbatim `!!Style Underline` — which the name-based check would otherwise call
  "missing" while injection (keyed on styleId) couldn't add a duplicate. Computing
  "missing" after the repair also makes the legacy-remap mixed/pure mode correct.

- **Legacy debate styles, shared between the cleaner and the importer**
  (`ooxml/legacy-styles.ts`, `ooxml/style-clean/legacy-remap.ts`, `import/importer.ts`,
  `ooxml/styles.ts`). A single source of truth (`legacyRole`, `isUnambiguousLegacy`,
  `buildLegacyHeadingMap`) classifies the pre-Verbatim vocabulary — `Tags`/`Cards`/
  `Cites`/`Block Headings`/`Nothing` paragraph styles, `Author-Date`/`Debate
  Underline` character styles, plus earlier-Verbatim ids like `StyleBoldUnderline`.
  The **cleaner's** `remapLegacyStyles` runs only when a doc actually *uses* an
  unambiguous legacy style (resolved from usage, so a merged doc that merely defines
  them is untouched), reassigns each paragraph/run by name to the canonical style,
  and picks heading levels per document: in a "mixed" doc (Verbatim styles present)
  it trusts each heading's own outline level (0→H1 … 3→H4); in a pure pre-Verbatim
  doc it infers depth (deepest heading above tags → Block, growing up). Tags are
  Heading 4 regardless. The **importer** consumes the same table: `parseRPr`
  classifies legacy character styles via `legacyRole` (and now `Cite → cite_mark`,
  for files that store the cite under its alias-as-styleId), and a per-document
  `planLegacy` maps legacy paragraph styles to schema nodes with the same adaptive
  heading logic — so opening a legacy `.docx` reconstructs cards/tags/cites/headings
  instead of importing flat text. `StyleInfo` gained an `outlineLevel` for this.

- **Multiple file-search folders** (`editor/settings.ts`, `editor/settings-ui.ts`,
  `editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`). The single `fileSearchRoot` setting became a
  `fileSearchRoots` list, with a `sanitizeFileSearchRoots` migration from the old
  single value and a new `folderList` settings control (rows with a remove ×, plus
  "+ Add folder"). The palette loads every folder, keyed per-root so the existing
  per-root background index-update events merge in incrementally, and the merged
  view is de-duplicated by absolute path so nested/overlapping folders never search
  a file twice. The main-process indexer was already per-root, so it was unchanged.

- **Read mode permits drag-move + dropzone/receive edits** (`editor/read-mode-plugin.ts`,
  `editor/reading-marker.ts`, `editor/drag-controller.ts`, `editor/dropzone-ui.ts`,
  `editor/pairing/receive-pill-ui.ts`, `editor/nav-panel.ts`). Read mode's
  `filterTransaction` rejected every doc change except the reading marker; a new
  `READ_MODE_DRAG_META` is now also allowed (and dirties read mode so its redo
  works). The drag controller tags its move/copy and shelf-drop commits with it, so
  drag-move, cross-pane drops, and dropzone/receive drag-outs all land while
  reading; the nav panel no longer blocks starting a drag in read mode (its drop
  commits through the same controller). Dropzone and receive-pill click-inserts are
  tagged too, and in read mode append to the bottom of the doc (no editing caret to
  target). Plain typing stays locked.

- **Editor no longer locks after a blocking pop-up on Windows/Linux**
  (`editor/speech-doc-send.ts`, `editor/index.ts`, `editor/mobile-shell.ts`).
  `window.alert`/`confirm` steals OS-level focus from the contenteditable; macOS
  Chromium restores it on dismiss, Windows/Linux don't. The no-speech-doc `alert`
  (the `` ` `` path) — and the image-insert error alerts, the mobile unit-delete
  confirm, and the web "needs desktop" alert — now reclaim focus via `view.focus()`
  after the modal, matching the pattern the existing mid-text `confirm` paths
  already used.

- **Pointer-centric drag auto-scroll** (`editor/drag-autoscroll.ts`,
  `editor/pill-tray.ts`, `editor/drag-controller.ts`, `editor/drag-editor-surface.ts`,
  `editor/nav-panel.ts`). Auto-scroll was tied to the drag's source surface and so
  didn't follow the pointer across panes. Replaced both per-surface implementations
  with a single `autoScrollUnderPointer`, driven once per move from the controller's
  `setPointer`: it `elementFromPoint`s the surface under the pointer (the pickup
  pill is `pointer-events:none`, so this sees through it) and nudges the nearest
  vertically-scrollable ancestor near its edge — so nav→editor, nav→nav, and
  editor→editor drags all scroll the right pane. The downward scroll is suppressed
  over the bottom-left pill-tray column (`pointerOverPillTrayColumn`) so a drag
  toward the dropzone/send/receive pills isn't fought by scrolling, and the up-band
  is offset below a `position: sticky` header pinned at a scroll container's top
  (`stickyTopInset`) so the multi-pane nav's sticky level bar no longer eats it.

- **Tolerant card-sharing version guard with a compatibility floor**
  (`editor/install-info.ts`, `editor/pairing/pairing-wiring.ts`,
  `apps/desktop/src/pairing-ipc.ts`, `editor/host/electron-host.ts`,
  `apps/desktop/src/preload.ts`). The cross-version guard previously dropped any
  received card whose sender version didn't `===` the receiver's, so two machines
  on different CardMirror versions couldn't share at all. It's now a compatibility
  *floor*: each sealed card carries an optional `minReceiverVersion`, and the
  poller accepts it unless that floor is set AND the local version is below it
  (`compareVersions`, a self-contained semver-ish comparator — numeric
  pre-release identifiers compare numerically, a bare release outranks a
  pre-release on the same core). A blank floor means any version may receive, so
  sharing is tolerant by default. The floor is a single documented constant,
  `CARD_COMPAT_MIN_VERSION` (currently `''`), stamped onto every outgoing card; a
  future release that changes the shared-card payload incompatibly sets it to its
  own version, after which clients older than that refuse the card and prompt to
  update while equal-or-newer clients accept — a breaking version can thus lock
  out already-shipped older clients (that carry this floor logic) without pushing
  them an update. `minReceiverVersion` is threaded through the pairing config, the
  sealed `InnerPayload`, and the configure/version-mismatch IPC types; the mismatch
  toast now reads "a shared card needs a newer CardMirror version (X or newer) —
  update to receive it." Note this governs clients from this release forward;
  alpha.18's exact-match guard is unchanged in already-built copies.

## 0.1.0-alpha.18 — 2026-06-21

- **Cross-machine card sharing — identity, crypto, and relay**
  (`apps/desktop/src/pairing-crypto.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/pairing-ipc.ts`,
  `apps/desktop/src/pairing-build.ts`, `dev/mock-relay/server.js`,
  `src/editor/pairing/relay-client.ts`, `src/editor/pairing/inbox-store.ts`,
  `src/editor/pairing/pairing-ids.ts`). Each install has a generated-once X25519
  keypair persisted to `userData/pairing-keys.json` (load-or-create, so updates
  never regenerate it); the public key, base64url-encoded with a `cmk1.` prefix, is
  the machine's shareable **code**, and a hash of it is the relay routing id.
  Sending seals each card (the dropzone's existing `Slice.toJSON()` payload) to the
  recipient's public key with an ephemeral-X25519 + AES-256-GCM sealed box, so the
  relay only ever stores opaque ciphertext — never the card, the sender, or the
  recipient. The Electron main process holds the relay base URL + bearer token
  (`pairing-ipc.ts`; token injected at build time into `pairing-build.ts`), POSTs
  one sealed message per recipient, and runs a poller (default 30 s) that GETs
  messages for its own routing id, unseals, `DELETE`s, and broadcasts them to the
  renderer; the inbox is persisted to `userData/pairing-inbox.json`. The relay
  forgets messages after 3 hours. A `dev/mock-relay` store-and-forward server
  implements the exact contract for local testing; production points at the
  scouting-assistant `/relay`. The renderer `relay-client` is transport-agnostic
  (delegates to the main-process bridge), so a web edition can be added without a
  client rewrite.

- **Cross-machine card sharing — Send/Receive pills + settings**
  (`src/editor/pairing/send-pill-ui.ts`, `src/editor/pairing/receive-pill-ui.ts`,
  `src/editor/pairing/pairing-wiring.ts`, `src/editor/settings.ts`,
  `src/editor/settings-ui.ts`, `src/editor/index.ts`). Two pills sit in a fixed
  `.pmd-pill-tray` next to the dropzone. The **Send** pill registers a `DragSurface`
  with the drag controller: dragging a card onto it expands a list of your
  recipients and groups as drop rows; dropping resolves recipient codes (a group
  fans out to its members) and routes the slice through the relay. The **Receive**
  pill is dropzone-style, backed by an `inbox-store`: incoming cards show the sender
  (your nickname for their code, else their self-name, else the code) and a relative
  time, the count badge tracks unread, and it green-pulses on arrival per the
  `pairingReceiveFlash` setting (`once` / `off` / `repeat`-every-10s-until-opened);
  opening it marks all read. Setup lives in **Settings → Card Sharing**:
  `pairingEnabled`, your own code (copy / regenerate — regenerating cuts off old
  shares), `pairingDisplayName`, a `pairingPartners` editor (nickname + code),
  `pairingGroups` (labeled member sets), and `pairingPollSeconds`. Directed
  addressing means you only ever poll for messages addressed to your own code and
  never address one to yourself, so there's no self-echo or delete-race. Desktop
  only for this version.

## 0.1.0-alpha.17 — 2026-06-20

- **Quote-insensitive text matching** (`editor/word-break.ts`,
  `editor/find-replace-plugin.ts`, `editor/repair-paragraph-plugin.ts`). New
  shared `foldQuotes()` maps Word's smart quotes (`‘ ’ ‚ ‛` → `'`, `“ ” „ ‟` →
  `"`) to straight ASCII. Both Find's `findMatches` and the paragraph-repair
  `findBodyMatches` now fold the haystack AND the needle before `indexOf`, so a
  query typed with straight quotes matches curly text and vice versa. The fold
  is strictly length-preserving (each BMP char → one ASCII char), so the
  character offsets still map back to the correct doc positions — match ranges
  land on the real (curly) characters, and Replace edits the right span.

- **Repair Paragraph Integrity workflow** (`editor/repair-paragraph-plugin.ts`,
  `editor/repair-paragraph-ui.ts`). A card-scoped workflow for re-splitting a
  collapsed body. `repairParagraphPlugin` owns the workflow view-state (active
  flag, the operated-on card range, the query, and match positions) and paints:
  a green `Decoration.node` box around the operated-on card the whole time it's
  open (`.pmd-repair-card-box`, the green analog of the AI working box's
  `.pmd-ai-working` card outline), plus green inline decorations over every body
  match — `.pmd-repair-match`, with the lone Enter-ready match a stronger
  `.pmd-repair-match-single` (the green analog of Find's current-match). `findBodyMatches` scans only the card's body
  textblocks (`card_body` / `cite_paragraph` / `undertag`), never the tag, using
  the same `pos + 1 + idx` offset mapping Find uses. The bar UI captures the
  enclosing card range at open (so focusing the input doesn't lose scope),
  pushes the query via `setQuery` meta, reads the match count back to toggle the
  in-box check + green entrance/reached-one pulse, and on Enter calls
  `buildSplitForSingleMatch` — `tr.split(matchFrom)` (guarded by `canSplit` and a
  parentOffset>0 "already a paragraph start" check) which yields two `card_body`
  siblings with the phrase leading the second; the same transaction clears the
  query for the next phrase. The card range maps forward through every doc
  change (including the split) so highlights track edits.
  **Ctrl-Enter** splits the same way but also *designates* the new paragraph for
  indent-on-exit: `buildSplitForSingleMatch(state, true)` tags its `afterSplit`
  meta, and the plugin records the tr's caret position in `designated[]`. Those
  positions map forward through every later edit, so as subsequent splits shrink
  the paragraph the marker keeps pointing at its (moving) start — the indent is
  deliberately deferred so it lands on the *final* paragraph, not the whole rest
  of the body. A `Decoration.node` (`.pmd-repair-indent-pending`, faint tint +
  a green bar in the left gutter) marks each designated paragraph. On exit,
  `buildExitTransaction` resolves each designated position to its current
  textblock and `setNodeMarkup`s `indent += INDENT_STEP_DXA` (deduped by block),
  then closes — so Esc both applies the pending indents and tears the workflow
  down. Wired as a new ribbon
  command `repairParagraphIntegrity` (label *Repair Paragraph Integrity*, no
  default key so it's rebindable, search aliases, a `ctx.openRepairParagraph`
  hook), registered in the editor plugin list and command bar.

- **Gap-fix no longer converts emphasis to underline for unrelated commands**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). `withGapFix` runs `applyFullGapTarget` over the
  edge gaps after *every* formatting command. Its underline-family rule treats
  underline and emphasis as one family, so both bookends emphasized → the gap
  fills with underline — the continuous read-aloud marker. That conversion was
  firing unconditionally, including for highlight/shading/font-size, so toggling
  highlight on a continuously-emphasized run rewrote its edge gaps to underline
  and visibly broke the emphasis at the selection boundaries. `withGapFix` now
  takes an `appliesNamedStyle` flag (true only for `applyUnderline` and
  `applyBodyMark`, i.e. underline/emphasis/cite); `applyFullGapTarget` keeps the
  emphasis→underline conversion when it's set, and otherwise falls back to the
  manual `fixFormattingGaps` rule, where emphasis+emphasis bridges with emphasis
  (preserved). Only the emphasis-on-both-sides case differs between the two
  rules — underline+underline, mixed underline/emphasis→underline, and cite+cite
  are identical either way. The `withGapFix` second argument changed from a bare
  `effectivePt` to an options object (`{ effectivePt, appliesNamedStyle }`); the
  two font-size callers updated accordingly.

- **Re-emphasizing inside a continuous emphasized phrase preserves it**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). The `appliesNamedStyle` fix above still let the
  emphasis→underline conversion fire on the emphasis command itself: emphasis is
  a one-directional apply (`applyBodyMark` always adds, never toggles off), so
  pressing F10 on a word inside an already-emphasized run re-ran the per-apply
  rule over its edge gaps (both bookends emphasized) and converted them to
  underline — same broken seams as the highlight case, but it couldn't be solved
  by the flag because this *is* a named-style apply and the conversion is wanted
  when joining two separately-emphasized words. The distinguishing signal is the
  gap's own pre-command emphasis: separately-emphasized words have a plain gap (a
  real seam); a continuous phrase has an already-emphasized gap. `applyFullGapTarget`'s
  `appliesNamedStyle` branch now bridges with emphasis (not underline) when both
  bookends *and* the gap are emphasized (`rangeFullyHasMark(tr.doc, gapFrom,
  gapTo, emphasisType)` — a new "throughout" helper, since PM's `rangeHasMark`
  is "anywhere"). The command only marks the operating word, never the flanking
  edge gaps, so `tr.doc` at the gap still reflects its pre-command state. The
  formatting-gaps test for the separate-words join was rewritten to use a
  realistic plain-gap setup (it previously used pre-emphasized gaps, which the
  new rule correctly reads as continuous).

- **Explicitly-selected edge punctuation is formatted, not gap-stripped**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). The operating range can include trailing/leading
  punctuation the user deliberately selected (`government.` with the period);
  the command marks it, but `withGapFix` then ran `applyFullGapTarget` over the
  whole bookend-to-bookend gap and, when the neighbor disagreed, stripped the
  mark right back off that punctuation. Punctuation should only count as gap for
  *bridging* (an unselected `. ` between two underlined words still bridges); a
  selected punctuation mark is the user's choice. New `gapModRange(doc, gapFrom,
  gapTo, r)` shaves the in-selection punctuation run off each end of the gap and
  returns the sub-range the gap-fix may write; `applyFullGapTarget` takes that
  `[modFrom, modTo)` and confines its `addMark`/`removeMark` (and the
  `rangeFullyHasMark` continuity check) to it, while still deciding bridge-vs-strip
  from the unchanged bookends. Whitespace is intentionally *not* protected, so a
  selected trailing space is still normalized away — matching the Layer-3 trim's
  space-only policy (`government. ` → period underlined, space not).

- **A structural-led paste preserves its full structure instead of demoting**
  (`editor/paste-plugin.ts`). When the clipboard leads with structural content
  and the cursor is in a card/analytic_unit body, PM's default fitting demoted
  it: the clipboard's flat, open `[tag, card_body, …]` shape (what a selection
  starting inside a tag, or a whole-card copy, produces) has its *open* head
  merged into the cursor's body, stripping the tag and absorbing the rest.
  Diagnosis: a *closed* structural slice splits correctly on its own, but PM
  leaves a phantom empty-tag card for the post-cursor remainder. The rewritten
  `tryPasteSplitContainer` now (a) accepts any structural lead — `tag` /
  `analytic` / `pocket` / `hat` / `block` / whole `card` / `analytic_unit` — not
  just a lone tag/analytic; (b) re-groups the flat nodes into proper containers
  via `groupStructuralNodes` (a bare `tag` + following bodies → `card`, a bare
  `analytic` → `analytic_unit`, with `fitForCard`/`fitForAnalyticUnit` coercing
  bodies to each container's content rule); (c) preserves the WHOLE pasted
  structure (head + content), where the previous code synthesized a single head
  and dropped the body; and (d) absorbs the destination's post-cursor remainder
  into the LAST pasted container (so two clean cards result, no phantom), or —
  when the paste ends in a doc-level heading — ejects and lifts the remainder to
  the doc root via `liftToDocRoot`. `handlePaste` tries the slice PM handed us
  first, falling back to `reparseClipboardStructuralSlice` (a doc-level,
  context-free re-parse of the clipboard `text/html`, re-running the
  `transformPasted` fresh-id + table-unwrap normalization) for the case where PM
  already flattened the head to inline in the slice. Replaces the old
  `detectPastedHead` / `findHeadInSlice` / `parseHeadFromHTML` single-head path.

- **"Fix" / "repair" are command-search synonyms** (`editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`).
  `searchCommandSource`'s per-command `haystack` now appends `repair` to any
  command whose label contains `fix`, and `fix` to any whose label contains
  `repair`, so each word matches commands named with the other. This covers the
  three existing fix/repair commands (`repairText`, `repairFormatting`,
  `fixFormattingGaps`) and any future ones automatically — the expansion is
  driven off the label text, not a hardcoded id list. The synonym terms join the
  existing `RIBBON_COMMAND_ALIASES` in the haystack, so they affect matching only,
  not display, and label hits still outrank alias/synonym-only hits in the
  ranking pass.

## 0.1.0-alpha.16 — 2026-06-17

- **`fileSearchFormats` setting controls which formats the file search lists**
  (`editor/settings.ts`, `editor/settings-ui.ts`,
  `editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`). New `'both' | 'cmir' | 'docx'` setting
  (default `'both'`), added to the `Settings` type, `DEFAULTS`, `sanitize`
  (garbage → `'both'`), the `SettingMeta` kind union, and `SETTING_METADATA`
  (Settings → General, `electronOnly`, next to the file-search folder option).
  Rendered as a three-way radio group (`buildFileSearchFormatsEditor`,
  mirroring `buildSpeechDocFormatEditor`, with a `settings.subscribe` re-sync).
  The search UI filters the cached file list at search time via
  `filterFilesByFormatSetting` (using the existing `fileFormat(f.path)`) at both
  result-building sites (the `f ` prefix and the no-prefix everything-search),
  so toggling it needs no re-scan and takes effect on the next search. The scan
  still lists both formats; this is a display filter. (The empty-folder message
  no longer hardcodes ".cmir".)

- **Command-bar file search lists `.docx` files**
  (`apps/desktop/src/main.ts`, `editor/file-search.ts`,
  `editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`). The recursive scan behind
  `host:list-cmir-files` (`scanCmirFiles`) now matches `.docx` as well as
  `.cmir` (and skips Word's `~$…` owner/lock files). Results badge the format:
  `badgeText` for a `file` row returns `fileFormat(filePath).toUpperCase()`
  (`CMIR` / `DOCX`) instead of `FILE`, and the displayed name is run through
  `stripFileExt` so the extension isn't shown (the badge already conveys it;
  the search now matches on the bare name, not the extension). Enter opens
  either format — `openFileByPath` → `routeOpenedFile` already routes `.docx`
  through `fromDocxFull`, and `host:read-file-at-path` already returns docx
  bytes — so no open-path change was needed. Tab dives into either format to
  search its objects: the in-file dive (`enterInFile`) and the background warm
  pass (`runWarmPass`) parse via a new `parseFileDoc(bytes, format)` helper
  (`.docx` → `fromDocx`, `.cmir` → `parseNative`) instead of `parseNative`
  directly. Everything downstream — `extractFile`, the outline, the warm cache,
  slice-on-insert — already worked off the parsed schema doc, which `fromDocx`
  and `parseNative` produce identically, so no other change was needed for full
  `.docx`/`.cmir` parity. (Internal IPC/type names keep the `cmir` prefix.)

- **Emphasized selections fill only their EDGE gaps with underline**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). When a formatting apply runs, `withGapFix`
  normalizes the gaps around the edit, but only at the OUTER edges of the user's
  selection — internal seams are left as the command set them. The edges are now
  derived from the OPERATING ranges (`getOperatingRangesForFormatting` with the
  `wordRangeAtCursor` fallback — the same ranges the wrapped commands use),
  computed from the pre-command state, NOT from the transaction's mark steps.
  Mark steps were the wrong source: on a mixed-format selection `addMark` skips
  an already-styled sub-range and an excluded-mark removal becomes its own step,
  so step edges land on internal seams (e.g. F10 across emphasized→underlined→
  plain text produced an `addMark` step starting at the emphasized/underlined
  seam, and the merge wrongly underlined that seam). The operating range spans
  the whole selection, so its only edges are the true outer ones; a gap whose
  bookends are both inside it (`gapFrom-1 >= r.from && gapTo < r.to`) is skipped.
  (Mark steps don't move positions, so pre-command ranges stay valid in the
  resulting doc.) Edge gaps get `applyFullGapTarget`, whose named-style rule
  treats underline and emphasis as one family: both bookends carrying either
  (including emphasis+emphasis) → the gap fills with UNDERLINE, so two
  separately-emphasized words join by underline — seamless because
  `.pmd-emphasis` already renders `text-decoration: underline` (the extra
  bold/italic/box/size stays on the words). The manual Fix Formatting Gaps
  command keeps its own per-gap rule unchanged (emphasis+emphasis → emphasis):
  it's a stateless normalizer with no selection-edge concept, so bridging
  like-with-like preserves contiguous emphasized phrases. Cite is unchanged.

- **Per-apply gap normalization honors explicit punctuation selections**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). `withGapFix` skips its cleanup for a changed
  range the user selected deliberately. That skip was whitespace-only
  (`/^\s*$/`); it now fires for any changed range with no bookend word
  character — whitespace, punctuation, or a mix. A new `WORD_CHAR_RE`
  (the same `[A-Za-z0-9'"‘’“”]` bookend class `GAP_REGEX` uses) drives the
  test (`if (!WORD_CHAR_RE.test(textBetween)) continue`), so a selection that
  is entirely gap content (e.g. `...`, `, `, ` -- `) keeps the style applied to
  it instead of being stripped/bridged, even when a flanking word is styled.
  Formatting a real word still bridges punctuation gaps to a styled neighbor as
  before (the changed range has a word char, so the cleanup runs).

- **Name/id-based analytic recognition on import**
  (`ooxml/styles.ts`, `import/importer.ts`, `import/index.ts`). The importer
  used to resolve a paragraph's node type by an exact match of its `w:pStyle`
  styleId against `PSTYLE_TO_NODE` (`Heading1`…`Heading4`, `Analytic`,
  `Undertag`) — it never read `word/styles.xml`, so it had no access to a
  style's human-readable name or its type. Analytics authored under a
  different template's style therefore imported as plain body paragraphs.
  Import now reads and parses `styles.xml` into a `styleId → {name, type}`
  map (`parseStyles`, threaded through `importDoc`'s new optional `stylesXml`
  arg and `ImportContext.styles`), and `resolveNodeType` adds a fallback
  (`fallbackNodeType` in `styles.ts`) when the exact lookup misses: (1) a
  style whose name or styleId is "Analytic Real" → `analytic`; (2) a
  **paragraph-type** style whose name or styleId contains "analytic" →
  `analytic`. Matching is case-insensitive and whitespace-insensitive (so the
  display name "Analytic Real" and the space-stripped styleId "AnalyticReal"
  both match). The paragraph-type guard keeps linked character styles out of
  rule 2; ordering after the exact lookup means canonical styles are never
  reclassified. The styleId-based checks still fire when `styles.xml` is
  absent (a minimal `StyleInfo` is synthesized from the pStyle token).

- **Outline pane resizable in multi-pane mode**
  (`editor/nav-panel.ts`, `editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`, `editor/style.css`).
  The single-doc nav panel has always carried a right-edge drag handle that
  writes the `--nav-width` CSS variable and persists the `navWidth` setting. In
  multi-doc mode the per-section `NavigationPanel`s each still built that handle,
  but they're hidden by CSS (`.pmd-multi-nav-body .pmd-nav-resize-handle`) —
  the sections share the rail evenly via flex and have no independent width to
  drag, so multi-pane had no working handle at all. The handle logic is now an
  exported `installNavResizeHandle(host)` (factored out of
  `NavigationPanel.installResizeHandle`, which delegates to it), and the
  `MultiPaneShell` constructor calls it on the rail element (`.pmd-multi-nav`,
  also sized by `--nav-width`). Because both layouts read and write the same
  variable and the same `navWidth` setting, the width carries across a
  single-↔multi layout switch. The rail handle is a direct child of
  `.pmd-multi-nav` (not `.pmd-multi-nav-body`), so the existing hide rule
  doesn't catch it; the hover/drag highlight selector gains a
  `.pmd-multi-nav.pmd-nav-resizing` variant.

## 0.1.0-alpha.15 — 2026-06-17

- **Per-apply gap normalization for the formatting family**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`, `editor/index.ts`). Formatting operating ranges
  are trailing-trimmed by `getOperatingRangesForFormatting` (Layer 3, so a
  double-clicked `word ` styles only the word) — right for toggle-ON, but a
  toggle-OFF left the adjacent space still styled, and word-by-word toggle-ON
  left visible breaks between styled words. Both are now handled by running the
  gap logic automatically after each formatting apply. A new
  `withGapFix(command, effectivePt?)` wraps each formatting factory
  (`applyUnderline`, `applyBodyMark` cite/emphasis, `applyHighlight`,
  `applyShading`, `setHighlightColor`, `setShadingColor`, `adjustFontSize`,
  `setFontSize`). After the wrapped command runs, it reads the ranges its mark
  steps changed (positions are stable across `AddMarkStep`/`RemoveMarkStep`),
  expands each to the adjacent bookend word via `expandToAdjacentBookends`, and
  runs the FULL gap target — `applyFullGapTarget`, every formatting family, the
  same rule the manual Fix Formatting Gaps command uses — over those gaps via
  `forEachGap`, in the command's OWN transaction (one undo step). So applying
  any one style also tidies the others' gaps around the edit (bridge a style
  both new neighbors share, strip one the bookends don't agree on). Two limits
  keep it from surprising: it runs only around the **changed ranges** (a far
  gap elsewhere in the paragraph is untouched), and a changed range that is
  itself **whitespace-only** is skipped — explicitly formatting only whitespace
  is honored even when a flanking word is styled. (`font_size` gaps are
  normalized only when an `effectivePt` resolver is supplied — the size
  commands; the visible styles always are.) Replaces the bespoke
  `clearDanglingBoundaryStyle`. The shared underline handling now covers
  `underline_direct` (structural blocks like tags), in both `applyFullGapTarget`
  and `fixFormattingGaps`, so the manual command also bridges direct underline
  in tags.

- **Bulk structural re-apply / replace over a shadow selection**
  (`editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). `selectAllOfStyle` (right-click a ribbon style
  button) sets shadow ranges and collapses the PM selection, but
  `applyStructuralToSelection` only read the real selection — so a shadow
  spanning many blocks couldn't be re-styled. The structural commands
  (`setTag`/`setAnalytic`/`setUndertag`/`setHeading`) now, in their
  empty-selection branch, try two shadow handlers before the single-cursor
  logic. (1) `bulkReapplyStructuralOnShadow` — when the shadow's blocks already
  match the pressed style, `removeMark`s `font_size` across every same-type
  block in one transaction (the same-type re-press effect, scaled to all
  matches; keeps the shadow alive via `META_OPERATING_ON_SHADOW`). The intended
  way to scrub stray imported `.docx` sizes off all tags. (2)
  `bulkReplaceStructuralOnShadow` — converts each matched block to a different
  style. `applyStructuralToSelection`'s core is extracted to
  `computeStructuralReplacement(state, from, to, opts)`; the bulk path runs it
  per shadow range and applies the per-doc-child replacements back-to-front (so
  lower positions stay valid) in one transaction. Container head swaps go
  through dedicated node-builders `cardToAnalyticUnitNode` /
  `analyticUnitToCardNode` (extracted from the cursor commands) instead of
  `transformDocChild`, which would dissolve the card and lift the cite/body to
  doc level; heading↔heading and rarer cross-tier conversions use the shared
  transform. No `META_OPERATING_ON_SHADOW`, so the now-stale matches dissipate.
  Only fires for `fromShadow` selections; real selections keep the contiguous
  apply.

- **Trailing-pilcrow selection cue** (`editor/pilcrow-selection-plugin.ts`,
  `editor/index.ts`, `editor/style.css`). A selection's end can land at offset
  0 of a later textblock — the shape Ctrl/Alt-Shift-Down produces (and native
  Shift-Down past a block's end). The paragraph break between the last
  visibly-selected block and that block is then *inside* the selection with no
  glyph marking it, so deleting or replacing the range merges the two blocks —
  surprising, because the grabbed break is invisible. A display-only plugin now
  makes it visible the way Word's end-of-paragraph selection decoration does:
  its `decorations(state)` checks the same predicate as `type-over-boundary.ts`
  (selection end at `parentOffset === 0` of a textblock, selection start before
  that block), finds the leading block's content-end via
  `Selection.near(resolve(tailBlockStart), -1).to`, and draws a
  `Decoration.widget` (`¶`, `side: -1`, `ignoreSelection: true`) there. It
  changes no behavior — it's recomputed from the live selection and is never a
  mark. The cue is styled to read as a flush continuation of the selection: it
  inherits the line's font metrics and uses `display: inline-block` so its
  highlight box matches the full line-box height of the native `::selection`
  rectangle around it (an inline span would paint only the glyph's
  ascent/descent and pinch in where line-height exceeds the glyph). Covers the
  trailing/downward case only.

- **Caret stays in the leading block when a cross-boundary delete can't merge**
  (`editor/boundary-cursor-keymap.ts`, `editor/index.ts`,
  `editor/voice/dispatch.ts`, `editor/ai/cite-creator.ts`). The same
  trailing-break-grab selection that the pilcrow cue marks lands the caret at
  the START of the next block after a delete, because `deleteSelection` leaves
  it at the mapped selection end. When the two blocks merge (plain paragraphs)
  that's fine, but when an `isolating` boundary blocks the merge — e.g. select a
  card's tag including the break and Backspace — the delete empties the leading
  block yet leaves both blocks standing, and the caret wrongly jumps into the
  untouched next block. New `deleteSelectionKeepingLeadingCursor` runs a
  throwaway `deleteSelection` probe and compares the doc's textblock count: if
  it's unchanged the leading block survived (emptied) without merging, so it
  instead does a clean delete of only the leading block's selected content
  (`[from, leadingEnd]`, where `leadingEnd = Selection.near(resolve(
  tailBlockStart), -1).to`), which leaves the break/trailing block untouched and
  the caret maps cleanly into the emptied block; if the count dropped the blocks
  really merged (or a whole tag-only card was removed) and the plain delete's
  caret is correct. Position-mapping the survivor directly is unreliable —
  `deleteSelection` collapses the content and the boundary into one cut point,
  so no original position resolves back inside the emptied block. Wired as the
  last Backspace/Delete fallback after the tag-boundary commands
  (`keepCursorInLeadingBlockOnBlockedMerge`), and reused by the voice `delete`/
  `deleteQuote`/`retype` commands. AI Format Cite gets the equivalent at its
  insert site: after the `TextSelection.between` clamp, a `to` that sits at
  `parentOffset === 0` of a later block is pulled back to the leading block's
  end before `insertText`, and the caret is pinned to the end of the inserted
  cite (a selection reaching INTO the next block's text — `parentOffset > 0` —
  is left to the existing own-paragraph split). Enter/`splitBlock` over such a
  selection is not yet covered.

- **Explicit font size overrides the per-style display size on cite / underline
  / emphasis** (`schema/marks.ts`, `editor/style.css`). `.pmd-cite`,
  `.pmd-underline`, and `.pmd-emphasis` hard-set `font-size: var(--pmd-size-*)`
  (the per-style display size). Since these named-style marks render INSIDE the
  outermost `font_size` wrapper, that rule clamped the glyph to the display size
  and an explicit per-run size only grew the wrapper's box — line height and the
  selection band changed, the letters didn't. The `font_size` mark's `toDOM`
  now also publishes `--pmd-run-font-size`, and the three rules read
  `font-size: var(--pmd-run-font-size, var(--pmd-size-<style>))` — so a run that
  carries a `font_size` mark uses it, otherwise it falls back to the display
  size. This makes the render match `ptForRun`'s precedence (a `font_size` mark
  is "direct" and wins) and Word's direct-`<w:sz>`-over-character-style
  semantics. Note: imported docs whose cite/underline/emphasis runs carry a
  stored `<w:sz>` now render at that size instead of the uniform display size
  (consistent with the size chip, which already flagged them as direct).

## 0.1.0-alpha.14 — 2026-06-13

- **macOS voice no-audio: microphone permission/entitlement + capture fixes**
  (`apps/desktop/package.json`, `apps/desktop/build/entitlements.mac.plist`,
  `apps/desktop/src/voice/ipc.ts`, `editor/voice/controller.ts`,
  `editor/voice/capture.ts`). The mic could be selected and the stream
  connected, but every sample was zero (running context, native rate, processor
  firing, peak ≈ 0). The **root cause**: the packaged app is hardened-runtime +
  ad-hoc-signed, but electron-builder's default entitlements omit
  `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` and there was no
  `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` — so macOS handed back a silent track while
  getUserMedia "succeeded". Fixes: a custom `entitlements.mac.plist` granting
  `audio-input` (wired via `mac.entitlements` + `entitlementsInherit`, with
  `hardenedRuntime: true` explicit) — **including
  `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`**, which electron-builder's
  default carries and a custom file must keep, or the hardened runtime refuses
  to load the Electron Framework in an ad-hoc build and the app crashes at
  launch; an `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in `mac.extendInfo`; and a
  `systemPreferences.askForMediaAccess('microphone')` call in the
  `host:voice-start` handler (darwin-only) that prompts on first use and returns
  `voice-mic-denied` (surfaced as an "enable it in System Settings" toast) if
  refused. Two supporting audio-path fixes: (1) the `AudioContext` is created
  after `await getUserMedia` — outside the user-gesture tick — so Chromium could
  start it *suspended*, leaving the ScriptProcessor's `onaudioprocess` to never
  fire; now `await ctx.resume()` after creation. (2) It no longer forces
  `new AudioContext({ sampleRate: 16000 })`, which makes a `MediaStreamSource`
  emit silence on macOS Core Audio when the input device runs at 44.1/48 kHz
  (Linux/PulseAudio happened to resample it); it now uses the context's native
  rate and downsamples each capture buffer to 16 kHz in-app (`downsampleTo16k`,
  box-average anti-aliasing; the worker still expects 16 kHz mono s16le).

- **`bold_off` mark — un-bolding inside bold-by-default blocks**
  (`schema/marks.ts`, `ribbon-commands.ts`, `import/importer.ts`,
  `export/exporter.ts`). Tags/headings render bold via CSS, and the `bold`
  mark only ADDS bold — so there was no way to represent (or display) a word
  explicitly un-bolded inside a tag: docx `<w:b w:val="0"/>` was dropped on
  import (the run then rendered bold from the tag's style) and never emitted
  on export. New `bold_off` mark, mutually exclusive with `bold` (`excludes`),
  renders an inline `font-weight: normal` that beats the `.pmd-tag` rule and
  round-trips to `<w:b w:val="0"/>`. Mod-B / the Bold button is now
  context-aware (`toggleBold`): in a bold-by-default structural block
  (tag / analytic / pocket / hat / block) it toggles `bold_off`; in body it
  toggles `bold` as before. `bold_off` is in the direct-formatting strip set,
  so Clear to Normal and promotion restore the block's default bold — but NOT
  the named-style apply-strip, so applying cite/underline/emphasis to a
  deliberately un-bolded word doesn't silently re-bold it. Import maps
  `<w:b w:val="0"/>` → `bold_off` (was: dropped); export emits it. Like
  `font_size`, it parses only its own `data-bold-off` span (not arbitrary
  `font-weight: normal`), so it isn't sprayed onto pastes carrying an
  explicit-normal weight.

- **Lock Highlighting** (`create-reference.ts` `lockHighlighting`, wired in
  `ribbon-commands.ts` + `ribbon-groups.ts` + the Card menu's Highlighting
  submenu). In-place sibling of Create Reference: a `Command` that drops each
  highlighted run's `highlight` mark and adds the protected light-gray
  (`C0C0C0`) `shading`, freeing the highlight layer so the card can be
  re-highlighted in one pass. Scope follows the selection: non-empty selection
  → the selected range; empty selection → the nearest enclosing `card` /
  `analytic_unit` (`enclosingCardRange`), and a no-op if the cursor isn't in
  one — deliberately NOT the smallest enclosing container, so it never locks a
  whole `block` / `hat` / `pocket`. One undo step. Differs from Create
  Reference: edits in place (no clipboard), writes no `<<… FOR REFERENCE>>`
  heading, leaves font size alone, and never sets a gray `font_color` (the
  point is to keep the card editable). Existing `shading` runs are left
  untouched, so it's idempotent on already-locked text. No default keybinding;
  rebindable; in the command palette via aliases (lock highlights / grey
  highlights / rehighlight). Distinct from the existing `highlightToShading`,
  which preserves each highlight's color rather than forcing gray.

- **Spell check joins style-split words** (`viewport-spellcheck.ts`).
  `computeDecos` ran the word regex over each text node separately, so a word
  whose styling changes mid-word — which ProseMirror stores as adjacent text
  nodes with different marks ("signifi" underlined + "cant") — was checked as
  fragments and the fragments flagged. It now iterates textblocks (not text
  nodes), joins each block's inline content into one string with a
  char→doc-position map (non-text inline nodes insert a sentinel `WORD_RE`
  can't match, so words don't span an image/break), and checks/decorates the
  whole word across the mark boundary. The per-block detection is extracted to
  a pure `misspelledRangesIn` helper. Analogous to the earlier possessive-
  apostrophe fix: check the real word, not a fragment.

- **`.cmir` gzip compression** (`native/codec.ts`, `native/index.ts`,
  `docid.ts`). The native file is now a gzip-wrapped JSON envelope — the JSON
  shape and `formatVersion` are unchanged, since compression is a container
  concern. The format is self-describing by magic bytes: legacy plaintext
  always begins with `{` (0x7B), gzip with 0x1F 0x8B, which never collide, so
  `parseNative` sniffs the first two bytes and either inflates or passes the
  bytes through. Old uncompressed files keep opening with no version flag;
  `serializeNative` minifies then gzips (level 6). `looksLikeNative` and the
  one direct-bytes bypass (`docid.ts`) are gzip-aware; `stampDocId` mirrors
  the input's format (compressed stays compressed, plaintext stays plaintext).
  Codec is **fflate** (synchronous, dependency-free): `parseNative`/
  `serializeNative` run in the Electron renderer and the browser build, where
  `node:zlib` isn't available and `CompressionStream` is async — going async
  would ripple through every call site. ~10× smaller corpus-wide; inflation on
  open is a small fraction of the JSON parse and happens only on open/dive
  (never on the file listing or repeated in-file search). Alpha policy:
  one-shot read+write, no two-phase rollout — users update rather than sharing
  across versions.

- **Bulk-compress migration tool** (`bulk-compress-ui.ts`; `host:bulk-compress`
  in `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`, exposed via preload + `electron-host.ts`).
  Existing files only shrink as they're re-saved, so a bulk-converted corpus
  would stay uncompressed indefinitely; this Home-screen modal (Electron only)
  rewrites every `.cmir` under a chosen folder compressed, in place. The
  per-file loop runs in the **main process** — not the renderer like
  bulk-convert — to avoid streaming the whole corpus across IPC and to get
  atomic rename + `utimes`. Each file is read, **skipped if already gzip**
  (idempotent / re-runnable / mixed-folder safe), gzipped (`node:zlib`),
  **verified** by inflating and comparing to the original, written to a temp
  file, **atomically renamed** over the original, and its **mtime restored**
  (so the command bar's recency ordering isn't disturbed). Progress streams
  back throttled (~10/s). Deliberately a transitional tool — isolated in its
  own file + handler so it's a clean deletion after a few releases.

## 0.1.0-alpha.13 — 2026-06-12

- **AI edit coordinator** (`ai/edit-coordinator.ts`, wired in `index.ts` +
  `multi-pane-shell.ts`, `style.css`). AI operations apply their edits after
  an async model call, capturing target positions up front. Concurrent ops —
  another AI op, or the user typing — moved the document underneath them, so
  positions drifted (cites landed at the wrong offset) or the op aborted
  outright (formatting repair bailed on any doc change). A new per-view
  plugin holds **edit leases**: each in-flight op claims its region, and the
  plugin remaps every lease through `tr.mapping` on every transaction (the
  same anchoring the comment marks and voice plugin use). Two guarantees fall
  out: edits *outside* a lease remap it (the op reads `lease.region()` at
  apply time instead of a stale offset), and edits *inside* a lease are
  blocked (`filterTransaction` rejects a non-bypass transaction that changes
  content length inside any live lease; the op's own writes carry a bypass
  meta). The shells also pre-check `coordinatorBlocks` in `dispatchTransaction`
  so a rejected user edit flashes the locked region (`.pmd-ai-locked-flash`).
  Disjoint ops run concurrently; an overlapping claim is rejected
  (`claimRegion` returns null → the caller toasts "try again in a moment").
  Leases are plugin state, never serialized; register/release/flash are
  meta-only, so they add no undo steps, and `markBypass` deliberately does
  *not* force `addToHistory: false` so an AI content edit stays undoable.
  Migrated every async doc-mutating AI op onto leases: cite creation
  (`cite-creator.ts`), text repair (`repair-text.ts` — its two passes share
  one lease, and `collapseToSingleUndo` was confined to the leased range via
  slices so it no longer reverts the whole doc, which would clobber a
  concurrent op's edits elsewhere), formatting repair (`repair-formatting.ts`
  — dropped the `doc !== startDoc` hard-abort; `applyFormatPlan` takes a
  uniform `delta` since in-region edits are blocked), and image alt-text and
  table extraction (`image-ai.ts`). For ops that captured many interior
  positions, a single `delta` re-anchors them all (valid because in-region
  edits are blocked, so the whole region moves uniformly).

  Making concurrency routine surfaced the single-slot AI cues
  (`ai-working-plugin.ts`, `ai-activity.ts`, `cite-creator.ts`,
  `thinking-tooltip.ts`): the ai-working plugin held one decoration and
  cite-creator kept a module-level `activeActivity` singleton, so a newly
  started op tore down a still-running op's box/pill. The plugin now keys its
  decorations by an `AiActivity` token (one box per op, each remapped
  independently through edits); cite-creator drops the singleton and gives
  each call its own activity, cleaned up in its own `finally`. The pinned
  "Thinking…" pills also queued onto the same spot when several targets
  scrolled off an edge; `ThinkingTooltip` now keeps a static registry and
  lays every pill out together — targets in view anchor above themselves,
  off-top targets stack downward from the top edge and off-bottom targets
  upward from the bottom edge in creation order, advancing as each finishes,
  grouped by editor so multi-pane panes stay independent.

- **Per-style paragraph spacing** (`settings.ts`, `settings-ui.ts`,
  `index.ts`, `style.css`). New `displayParagraphSpacing` setting — a
  `Record<'<style>Before' | '<style>After', number>` in points — defaulting
  to the editor's previous hard-coded per-style margins (e.g. pocket
  18/9 pt, tag 9/3 pt, body 0/0). `applyParagraphSpacing` pushes each to a
  CSS variable (`--pmd-para-<style>-before` / `-after`), and the `.pmd-*`
  margin rules now read those (with the original rem values as fallbacks,
  so zero-config rendering is unchanged). The Appearance editor
  (`buildParagraphSpacingEditor`, kind `paragraphSpacing`) is a 3-column
  grid (style / Before / After) with a reset-to-defaults button. The
  body-level CSS rule was split so cite, undertag, and body paragraphs take
  independent spacing, and the heading levels (pocket/hat/block) get their
  own values (line spacing groups them, but their margins differ).
  Display-only, like line spacing — not written to docx.

- **Structural-style apply: selection boundary and same-type re-press**
  (`ribbon-commands.ts`). Two refinements to applying tag/analytic/heading
  styles:
  - `applyStructuralToSelection` over-applied on a downward selection.
    Ctrl-Shift-Down extends the selection to offset 0 of the *next*
    textblock; that paragraph has nothing actually selected, but the
    doc-child sweep counted it as touched (its `cStart < to`) and restyled
    it. The function now pulls `to` back across the opening boundary when
    `$to.parentOffset === 0`, so only the genuinely-selected blocks convert.
    (The `selectionAcross` test helper had the same offset-0 shape — an
    inner text node overwriting `to` to the block start — and was fixed to
    `Math.max` to the block end so its multi-paragraph drags still include
    the last block under the new rule.)
  - Re-pressing a structural shortcut on a node that's already that type now
    clears its direct `font_size` marks (tag, analytic, pocket, hat, block —
    not undertag, per request). `stripIndentAtDepth` gained a `clearFontSize`
    option used by the same-type cursor branches; it strips `font_size` over
    the node's content alongside the existing indent reset, dispatching
    nothing when neither changes (no empty undo step). The selection path's
    same-type-in-container case (`transformDocChild`, kept untouched to avoid
    dissolving the card — audit 2026-06-10 P1#4) now routes those heads
    through a new `clearFontSizeOnNode` so an in-place re-press cleans their
    size without breaking the container; doc-level same-type heads already
    cleared via `asTransformed`'s promotion strip.

- **Settings + AI cite-prompt editor: stacked-Escape** (`settings-ui.ts`,
  `ai/edit-prompt-modal.ts`). Both opened their own `document` Escape
  listener, so Escape from the cite-prompt editor (opened from Settings)
  closed both. Both now join the overlay stack (`overlay-stack.ts`): push
  on open, pop on close, and guard Escape with `isTopOverlay`. The Settings
  modal is a shown/hidden singleton, so it pushes in `open()` (idempotent)
  and pops in `close()`.

- **AI cite-prompt editor instructions were stale**
  (`ai/edit-prompt-modal.ts`). The note claimed the model "MUST return JSON
  with `cite` and `tokens` fields", but the default prompt switched to a
  delimited `[[CITE]] … [[TOKENS]] … [[END]]` block (no JSON) that the
  parser splits on. Updated the note to describe that format and why it's
  parser-critical.

- **Line-spacing reset left stale input values** (`settings-ui.ts`,
  `buildLineHeightsEditor`). The editor re-renders on settings change only
  when focus isn't inside it (so it can't clobber a value mid-edit) — but
  the reset button holds focus, so clicking it set the settings (and CSS
  vars) without redrawing the number inputs. The reset handler now calls
  `render()` explicitly.

- **Appearance tab order** (`settings.ts`). Moved the `bodyFont` and
  `lineHeight` metadata entries to directly after `displayTypography` so
  Body font and Line spacing group with the other type controls.

- **Mobile starter doc** (`index.ts`, `makeMobileStarterDoc` +
  `isMobileLayout`). `makeNewDocBody` now picks a layout-specific
  onboarding doc: the desktop starter is all ribbon buttons / F-keys /
  Mod-chords, so on the mobile layout it would describe controls that
  don't exist. The mobile starter introduces the real touch affordances
  (☰ outline, ⋮ menu, Read/Move/Repair mode bar). The layout decision
  reuses `resolveMobileLayout`, recomputed because `makeNewDocBody` runs
  before the boot-time `BOOT_MOBILE` constant initializes.

- **Mobile nav drawer slid out under the mode sheets** (`style.css`). The
  drawer was `z-index: 320`, below the move/repair bottom sheet (325, which
  reuses `.pmd-mobile-movesheet`), the generic sheet (330), and the
  badge/popup layer (340), so opening the outline in Repair/Move mode left
  the sheet on top. Lifted the drawer to 350 and its scrim to 345 so the
  nav pane (and its dimming scrim) sit above every mobile bottom sheet.

- **Voice startup crashed on macOS: missing `vosk_recognizer_set_grm`**
  (`apps/desktop/src/voice/vosk.ts`). The macOS build is pinned to libvosk
  0.3.42 (the last with a prebuilt macOS binary); the dynamic-grammar
  swap `vosk_recognizer_set_grm` was added in 0.3.43, so koffi threw
  "cannot find function" while binding it and voice never started. The
  binding is now optional (bound in a try/catch), and `Recognizer.set-
  Grammar` falls back to recreating the recognizer via
  `vosk_recognizer_new_grm` (present in 0.3.42) when the in-place swap is
  unavailable — a graph rebuild, but it only fires on actual vocabulary
  changes, so dynamic doc vocab keeps working on macOS. Linux and Windows
  (libvosk 0.3.45) still use the in-place swap. Verified both paths against
  the bundled library.

- **Mic capture falls back to the default device** (`src/editor/voice/
  capture.ts`). `getUserMedia` was called with `deviceId: { exact }` from
  the saved `voiceInputDevice`; if that device isn't present (a deviceId
  from another machine, an unplugged mic) Chromium throws
  NotFoundError/OverconstrainedError and voice failed outright. It now
  retries without the device constraint, so it opens the system default;
  a genuinely device-less machine still surfaces "microphone unavailable."

The following came out of validating the 2026-06-10 audit against current
code (`reference-docs/AUDIT-2026-06-10.md`):

- **Change Case truncated text under length-growing case maps**
  (`src/editor/condense.ts`, `toggleCase`). It cased the whole selection to
  one string and re-sliced it back across text nodes by the *original*
  segment lengths, so a character whose uppercase is longer (German ß→SS,
  Turkish İ→i̇) shifted every later slice and ate the final character.
  Rewritten to transform each text-node segment in place (length-safe),
  with title-case carrying word state across segments (so a word split by a
  mark boundary capitalizes only its first letter), edits applied
  back-to-front so positions stay valid, and the selection re-mapped
  through the transaction. Regression tests in `tests/editor/condense.test.ts`.

- **Condense/merge dropped a merged heading's id** (`condense.ts`,
  `mergeRun`). `targetType.create(null, …)` discarded all attrs, so a
  demolish-mode merge whose first touched block was a tag/analytic emitted
  the merged heading with `id: null` — the documented "cursor appears in
  the card above" defect (`schema/ids.ts`): the heading still renders, but
  the nav pane skips it for caret-tracking/selection, and it's only
  repaired on the next `.cmir` load by `stampMissingHeadingIds`. `mergeRun`
  now carries the first source's attrs that the target type supports
  (notably `id`).

- **Find-bar decorations rebuilt on every view update**
  (`src/editor/find-replace-plugin.ts`). `props.decorations` rebuilt the
  full match `DecorationSet` on every update, including selection-only
  ones. Added a per-plugin-instance memo keyed on reference identity of
  (doc, matches, scope, currentIndex) — the plugin's `apply` returns the
  same state object when nothing relevant changed, so selection moves now
  reuse the prior set instead of re-allocating thousands of decorations.

- **Voice grammar-recreate fallback had a use-after-free window**
  (`apps/desktop/src/voice/vosk.ts`, from the macOS fix above). The
  fallback freed the old recognizer before building the replacement; if
  `vosk_recognizer_new_grm` failed/threw, `this.ptr` was left pointing at
  freed memory. It now builds the new recognizer first and frees the old
  only on success.

- **Persistent Flow host could be orphaned on abnormal quit**
  (`apps/desktop/src/flow-bridge.ts`). Only `before-quit` killed the
  PowerShell child, which is skipped on `app.exit()` or a `preventDefault`'d
  quit. Added a `will-quit` handler and a synchronous `process.on('exit')`
  backstop so the child (and its Excel COM reference) is always torn down.

- **Uncondense crashed on an invalid split** (`condense.ts`). A pilcrow in
  a container head (a tag — from a demolish merge, or pasting condensed
  body into a tag) made `tr.split` throw an uncaught `TransformError`
  (two tags in one card violates `tag (…)*`). Guarded with `canSplit`;
  when the split would be invalid the marker is just deleted. Regression
  test in `tests/editor/condense.test.ts`.

- **Editor comment ids overflowed Word's int32 `w:id`**
  (`comments-plugin.ts`). The counter seeded from `Date.now()` (~1.7e12),
  outside the signed-32-bit range OOXML allows. It now starts at 0 and is
  advanced past every id already present whenever threads load
  (`seedCommentIdCounter` in `loadThreads`), keeping new ids small and
  collision-free. Test in `tests/editor/comments-id.test.ts`.

- **Spellcheck flagged possessives** (`viewport-spellcheck.ts`). `WORD_RE`
  kept a trailing apostrophe, so "dogs'"/"James'" were looked up — and
  underlined — with the apostrophe attached. The trailing apostrophe is now
  trimmed before the dictionary check.

- **Floating format panel ignored `ribbonContext`** (`index.ts`). Its
  buttons called `getRibbonCommand(id)` with no context, so they fell back
  to `DEFAULT_RIBBON_CONTEXT` — e.g. applying the default highlight color
  instead of the live one, and ignoring the clear-on-toggle-off setting.
  They now pass the live `ribbonContext` like the ribbon and keymap.

- **Nav-drag editor auto-scroll was a no-op** (`nav-panel.ts`,
  `maybeAutoScroll`). It called `scrollBy` on `#editor`, which isn't the
  scroll container (the overflow is on an ancestor, `#app` single-doc), and
  gated on a mislabeled Y-only check. It now walks up to the real scroll
  container (`findEditorScrollGate`, mirroring `findNavScrollGate`) and
  gates on the pointer being over the editor in both axes (so a drag within
  the nav pane doesn't scroll the doc).

- **`insertSpeechSlice` could dispatch into a destroyed view**
  (`speech-doc-send.ts`). The `setTimeout(…, 0)` insertion read
  `speechView.state` and dispatched with no liveness check; closing the
  speech doc inside the defer window threw. Bails when ProseMirror has
  nulled the view's `docView`.

- **Nav and spellcheck context menus could both be open**
  (`nav-panel.ts`, `viewport-spellcheck.ts`). They tracked open state
  independently. Added a shared `context-menu-registry.ts`: each menu
  registers its closer on open (closing any other) and clears it on close.

- **docId stamping clobbered `docProps/custom.xml`** (`ooxml/docx.ts`,
  `writeDocId`). It wrote a fresh part containing only `cmirDocId`,
  deleting any other custom document properties — contradicting the
  lossless contract. It now reads the existing part and merges: strips a
  prior `cmirDocId`, appends ours with a fresh `pid`, and preserves every
  other property. Tests in `tests/round-trip/docid.test.ts`.

- **Tab/line-break export loss** (`export/exporter.ts`, `emitTextRun`).
  The importer maps `<w:tab/>`→'\t' and `<w:br/>`→'\n', but the exporter
  left those characters inside `<w:t>` content, where Word ignores them.
  `emitTextRun` now splits on '\t'/'\n' and emits `<w:tab/>`/`<w:br/>`
  (mirroring the existing no-break/soft-hyphen handling). Page-break type
  is still not preserved — a `<w:br w:type="page"/>` imports as '\n' and
  re-exports as a plain `<w:br/>` — because the doc model has no node for
  it; tracked separately. Test in `tests/round-trip/inverse.test.ts`.

- **Escape collapsed every stacked overlay at once** (new
  `overlay-stack.ts`; `learn-session-ui.ts`, `learn-create-ui.ts`,
  `learn-manage-ui.ts`, `quick-card-add-ui.ts`, `quick-cards-manage-ui.ts`).
  Those dialogs each attach a `document`-capture Escape listener;
  `stopPropagation` doesn't stop sibling listeners on the same node, so two
  stacked dialogs (e.g. opening the add/edit dialog from a manager list)
  both closed on one Escape. Added a shared overlay stack: each overlay
  pushes a token on open, pops it on close (paired with the existing
  `removeEventListener`), and guards its Escape branch with
  `isTopOverlay(token)` so only the most recently opened reacts. The
  command/search palette uses an input-scoped (target-phase) Escape, not a
  document-capture one, so it isn't part of this and is unchanged; broader
  rollout to other modals (settings, save-as, …) and a full shared-modal
  primitive (focus trap, `role="dialog"`) remain follow-ups. Logic test in
  `tests/editor/overlay-stack.test.ts`.

- **Comment lost when undoing a deletion** (`comments-plugin.ts`).
  `gcOrphanThreads` removed a thread whose `comment_range` mark was gone via
  a non-undoable transaction, so undoing the deletion restored the text and
  the mark but not the thread content — leaving a mark pointing at nothing.
  Added a per-document tombstone (in plugin state, so it can't leak across
  docs/panes; cleared on `load`). The GC pass is now bidirectional: it parks
  an orphaned thread in the tombstone instead of discarding it, and
  resurrects it when its mark reappears (undo/redo/paste). A new `gc` meta
  carries the reconciled `{threads, tombstone}`. Tests in
  `tests/editor/comments-gc.test.ts`.

- **Demolish-mode condense flattened tables** (`condense.ts`). The demolish
  path flattens every container in range into a single textblock run;
  `flattenForDemolish` recursed into a `table` too, pulling its cell
  paragraphs into the merge and destroying the rows/cells. The replacement
  builder also has nowhere to place an atomic block mid-merge. The command
  now scans the affected range for a `table` and bails (no-op) when it finds
  one, leaving the doc — and the table — intact. Test in
  `tests/editor/condense.test.ts`.

- **Block-level content controls dropped on import** (`import/importer.ts`).
  The body loop handled only `w:p`/`w:tbl`, so a `<w:sdt>` (structured
  document tag / content control) and everything inside it was skipped. It
  now unwraps `w:sdt` and imports its `w:sdtContent` children recursively
  (the wrapper carries no content of its own). Test in
  `tests/round-trip/import-sdt.test.ts`. Inline-level sdt and body-paragraph
  `w:jc` alignment remain unhandled (separate, lower-priority).

## 0.1.0-alpha.12 — 2026-06-12

- **Voice control failed to start in packaged builds.** The recognizer
  worker is forked under a real Node binary (`execPath`), which has no
  asar support and so could not load `worker.js` — or koffi — from inside
  `app.asar`; the forked process died instantly with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`
  and the session ended before it began. (Dev runs were unaffected:
  `__dirname` there is an ordinary directory.) Fixed by unpacking the
  worker tree and koffi — whose native binary lives in the per-platform
  `@koromix/koffi-<os>-<arch>` package — via electron-builder's
  `asarUnpack`, and rewriting the fork target from `app.asar` to
  `app.asar.unpacked` so the real Node loads it off disk. Windows, Linux,
  and Apple Silicon macOS now start a session in the packaged app. Intel
  macOS is still pending: the arm64 CI runner installs only the arm64
  koffi binary, so the x64 dmg ships without its native module.

- **Persistent Verbatim Flow host** (`apps/desktop/resources/flow/
  verbatim-flow.ps1` rewritten as a stdin server; `flow-bridge.ts`
  rewritten as a host manager). Each Flow action used to spawn a fresh
  `powershell.exe -File … -Verb …`, paying Windows PowerShell's cold start
  (CLR load, the OS scanning the launch) plus a fresh COM attach to Excel
  every time — seconds per send on a VM. The helper is now one long-lived
  process: it reads newline-delimited JSON requests on stdin and writes
  one JSON response per line, so payloads travel inline (no more per-call
  temp file). `flow-bridge.ts` spawns it lazily on the first verb,
  serializes requests (one in-flight; Excel COM is single-threaded),
  reassembles responses across stdout chunks, restarts the host if it
  dies, times a wedged request out at 20 s (tearing the host down so the
  next call respawns clean), and kills it on app quit. After the first
  send the cold start is gone and verbs run in milliseconds. Three ways to
  start it, all idempotent: lazily on first use, the new **Start Flow
  Connection** command (`startFlowHost`, a `ping` that warms the process
  without touching Excel), and a Windows-only **flowHostOnLaunch** setting
  that pre-warms it at renderer boot. No idle timeout — the host stays up
  for the session.

- **Voice-control toggle is now a rebindable command** (`toggleVoice`,
  default `Mod-Shift-V`). It moved off a fixed editor keymap into the
  ribbon-command registry, so it shows in the command bar and the
  keybindings editor and honors user overrides. It's view-less (works
  with no pane focused) and hidden off the desktop.

- **Ribbon-command availability gating** (new `ribbon-availability.ts`).
  The command bar, keybindings editor, and shortcuts reference now filter
  the command list through `isRibbonCommandAvailable()` — Flow commands
  appear only on the Windows desktop, voice only on desktop — and skip a
  group when nothing in it is available. The keymap still binds every
  command (each self-guards), and conflict detection still scans the full
  set, so a hidden binding can't be silently reused. Settings gained a
  `windowsOnly` flag with matching gating, used by the new Flow warm-host
  setting; `isWindowsHost()` (Electron + a `Windows` user-agent) is the
  shared check.

- **Send Headings to Flow sends only cite-marked text** (`flow-port.ts`).
  In headings-only mode a `cite_paragraph` now runs through
  `collectCiteText()` — the same nav-pane logic, with discontinuous
  cite-mark bridging and the ampersand-spacing fix — instead of emitting
  the whole paragraph's `textContent`. A cite line with no marks sends
  nothing, mirroring the nav preview.

- **Flow overwrite-prompt cancel no longer blurs the editor**
  (`flow-port.ts`). `window.confirm` steals focus from the contenteditable
  and the cancel branch returned without restoring it, so the editor
  silently stopped accepting keystrokes. Both the cancel and success paths
  now call `view.focus()` — the same fix `speech-doc-send.ts` already used.

- **Help → User Manual** (`main.ts`). The native Help menu links to the
  manual (MANUAL.md on GitHub) via `shell.openExternal`, alongside the
  existing Keyboard Shortcuts entry.

- **AI "Thinking…" pill anchors to an image's real box** (`thinking-
  tooltip.ts`, `ai-working-box.ts`). The shared pill positioned itself
  from `coordsAtPos(from/to)`, which returns only a degenerate caret rect
  for an inline atom like an image — so image alt-text / table-from-image
  ops pinned the pill to the editor's top-left corner. `rangeRect()` (the
  DOM-Range bounding box already used by the purple working box) is now
  exported and used by the pill too, so it anchors to the image and clamps
  to the corner only when the image scrolls off. Equivalent to the old
  behavior for text ranges; a collapsed range still falls back to a
  `coordsAtPos` point anchor.

- **Mobile settings gained the style-typography editor** (`mobile-
  settings-ui.ts`; `displayTypography` now `mobile: true`). A touch
  renderer for the `displayTypography` kind exposes the same per-style
  flags as the desktop (cite underline; undertag/emphasis bold-italic;
  emphasis box) plus an emphasis-box-thickness stepper (0.25–12 pt), not
  just the font-size steppers.

- **Mobile settings stack block editors under their description**
  (`mobile-settings-ui.ts`, `style.css`). The readers list and the
  per-style stepper/toggle editors used to sit in a fixed right-hand
  column, crushing a long description on a narrow screen. Rows whose kind
  is a multi-row block editor now get `pmd-msettings-row-block`, which
  switches the row to a vertical stack with a full-width control.

## 0.1.0-alpha.11 — 2026-06-11

- **Revamped "AI is working" affordance** (new `src/editor/ai/
  ai-activity.ts`, `ai-working-plugin.ts`; rebuilt `thinking-tooltip.ts`;
  used by cite-creator, repair-text, repair-formatting, image alt-text).
  A single `AiActivity` handle now pairs the floating "Thinking…" pill
  with a purple box over the worked-on region, kept in sync. The pill is
  anchored to the editor's left edge and clamps into the visible band —
  pinning to the top or bottom corner (above the dropzone) when the
  target scrolls off-screen, instead of spawning off-view as it did
  before. The box is a view-only decoration in two scopes: `container`
  outlines the enclosing card/unit (mirrors the blue drag-pickup box, in
  the pill's purple), while `selection` marks exactly the worked-on range
  — so selection-based actions (Format Cite, repair) box only the
  selected text rather than the whole containing card.

- **Steady-cursor accessibility setting** (`disableCursorBlink`; new
  `pmd-steady-cursor` body class via `applyCursorBlink` in `index.ts`;
  generalizes `italic-caret-plugin.ts`). The native text caret's blink
  can't be turned off in CSS, so when the setting is on the native caret
  is hidden in the editor (`caret-color: transparent` on `.ProseMirror`)
  and the custom-caret plugin — previously only drawn for a pending
  italic cursor — draws a steady, upright caret (in `--pmd-c-text`) at
  any collapsed cursor, repositioned on selection / scroll / resize /
  focus / settings change. Scoped to `.ProseMirror` so other inputs keep
  their native caret (hiding it there would leave no visible cursor).
  Off by default, under Accessibility.

- **Verbatim Flow integration — experimental, Windows only** (new
  `src/editor/flow-port.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/flow-bridge.ts`,
  `apps/desktop/resources/flow/verbatim-flow.ps1`; `flow*` host methods).
  The six commands are registered as command-palette / keyboard commands
  only — NO ribbon-toolbar buttons, and no default keybindings; the
  "Flow" entry in `ribbon-groups.ts` is purely the shortcuts-cheat-sheet
  / keybindings-editor taxonomy, not a toolbar group. Interoperates with
  Verbatim Flow (the Excel
  template `Debate.xltm`) the same way the Verbatim Word add-in does:
  entirely through the standard Excel COM object model, requiring no
  modification to Flow (a passive recipient of active-cell writes). The
  renderer can't speak COM, so the desktop main process spawns a fixed,
  bundled Windows-PowerShell helper that attaches to the running Excel
  (`[Marshal]::GetActiveObject`), finds the workbook whose name contains
  "flow", and writes the serialized blocks down its active column
  (`ActiveCell.Value2` → `Offset(1,0)`) — or reads the selected cells for
  Pull, or opens `Debate.xltm` for Create. Payloads cross via a temp-file
  arg (never the command line); results return as JSON on stdout. Send
  has four variants (cell vs column × all vs headings-only, where
  "headings" keeps tags/cites/headings and drops `card_body`) plus the
  overwrite guard Verbatim shows. Off Windows every call resolves to a
  "windows-only" result and nothing spawns. Audit + design in
  `reference-docs/SPEC-verbatim-flow-interop.md`.

- **Mobile layout — view-first shell for the web edition** (new
  `src/editor/mobile-shell.ts`, `mobile-plugin.ts`,
  `mobile-layout.ts`, `mobile-settings-ui.ts`, `structural-move.ts`;
  boot branch in `index.ts`; `body.pmd-mobile` CSS section).

  Activation: a new `mobileLayout` setting (`auto`/`mobile`/
  `desktop`, web-only) resolved ONCE per load by the pure
  `resolveMobileLayout` — `auto` picks mobile on any viewport
  narrower than 768px regardless of pointer, and up to 1024px on
  coarse pointers; native hosts never qualify. A `[cardmirror]
  mobile:` boot line logs the inputs and decision on the web
  edition. The shell rides the single-doc machinery (same mountView,
  open/save flows, recovery, home screen) rather than running its
  own editor: it forces the multi-pane branch off for the session
  WITHOUT writing the synced `multiDocWorkspace` setting (the
  mode-switch subscriber is gated so the disagreement never reads as
  a toggle), hides the desktop chrome via CSS, and re-points the
  single-doc layout variables at its own app bar / mode bar / status
  strip. The home screen shows documents only (no Quick Cards or
  flashcard sections), the dropzone pill is not mounted, and
  `runStartupRecovery` is skipped outright — the recovery sidebar is
  a desktop surface, so journals stay put and surface on the next
  desktop-layout launch.

  View-first mechanics: `mobilePlugin` (first in
  `buildEditorPlugins`, no-op outside the shell) supplies
  `editable: () => false` — PM treats editable as false if ANY prop
  says so, composing with the read-mode prop — which keeps the
  on-screen keyboard away entirely while history, decorations, and
  programmatic selection stay live. There is NO grab-and-drag from
  the editor surface on mobile (on touch it is indistinguishable
  from a scroll); structural movement is Move mode and the outline.
  In read mode the plugin's `handleClick` turns a tap into the
  reading-marker toggle at the tapped word (the touch equivalent of
  the Space/Enter binding, which a non-editable view never
  receives). Undo/redo sit permanently in the app bar and run
  `readModeAwareUndo/Redo`.

  Chrome: the outline drawer ADOPTS the desktop `#nav-panel` mount
  (same NavigationPanel instance — caret sync, level filters, and
  click-to-jump unchanged), slides in via left-edge swipe or ☰, and
  on tablet density (≥768px, `pmd-mobile-tablet`) pins as a
  persistent 260px rail that the same ☰ collapses and restores
  (anything that needs the outline — "Send to…" — un-collapses it). The drawer clips overflow and outline
  labels wrap up to three lines before ellipsis. Pinch on `#app`
  drives the SAME content zoom as the desktop status bar (`zoomPct`
  → `--editor-zoom`, CSS `zoom`): live preview writes the variable
  directly, the setting commits once at gesture end in 5% steps; an
  `Aa` sheet carries the slider, a reset-to-100% button, and theme
  segments. The ⋮ menu routes through `runRibbon` (now exported):
  Open, New, Export a copy (Save As → download on mobile browsers),
  Word count, Settings, Use desktop layout (reload), Home.

  Move mode (new `structural-move.ts`): tap a card or heading →
  `unitRangeAtPos` (position-based port of the drag surface's
  `findContainerAt` hit-test) selects the smallest structural unit,
  visualized by node decorations held in the mobile plugin's state;
  an action strip offers Up / Down / Send to… / Copy / Delete. One
  "step" is subtree-aware (`moveInsertPos`): the outermost heading
  subtree ending exactly at the unit's start is hopped whole
  (sibling swap), a bare parent heading line steps the unit out of
  its section, any other heading line is entered (the unit lands as
  the section's first child), and loose neighbors are hopped one
  node at a time. Execution rides the drag system's exported
  `buildMoveTransaction`, so a button move and a drag-drop produce
  identical docs and identical single undo steps; after each move
  the landing selection re-derives the unit so the highlight and
  sheet follow it. "Send to…" reuses the nav panel via a new
  destination-mode API (`enterDestinationMode(cb)`): the drawer
  opens with a banner, a row tap pops an above/below chooser
  anchored at the row, and the unit lands BESIDE the target's whole
  subtree (`entryUnitRange`), never inside it — inserting after a
  same-level heading's line would strand the target's own content
  under the moved unit. The chooser commits on release over a
  choice, so press-slide-release works as well as two taps;
  releasing elsewhere keeps destination mode for another pick, and
  dismissing the drawer cancels. Move and Read modes are mutually
  exclusive (read mode locks the doc and owns taps).

  Repair mode shares Move's tap-select machinery (a `tapMode` in the
  mobile plugin), restricted to CARDS — repairs run one card at a
  time, so heading taps resolve to no unit (with a toast saying so)
  rather than scoping a whole section. The repair sheet offers
  Repair Text / Repair Formatting — scoped to the card's BODY blocks
  only (first card_body/paragraph through the last; the tag and cite
  never enter the scope) — plus Repair Cite, which selects the
  tapped card's `cite_paragraph` — or, when the card has none, the
  first non-undertag paragraph beneath the tag (imported cards often
  carry their citation as plain body text) — and fires the AI cite
  creator (the Mod-Shift-X command). The buttons set a text selection and fire
  the existing ribbon commands — the repair flows read
  `state.selection` and can't tell a tap-made scope from a
  keyboard-made one, so the thinking/Clod progress pill (Clod
  governed by the same setting as desktop, exposed as a toggle in
  mobile Settings), orange flashes, toasts, and single-undo-step
  behavior are the shared implementation verbatim; the scope is
  scrolled on-screen before firing so the pill's anchor is visible.
  With AI features off or no API key on the device, the sheet
  explains and links to the mobile Settings page instead.

  Outline gestures on mobile: the list owns its pointer stream
  (`touch-action: none`). A drag pans the list manually under the
  pointer — identical behavior for mouse, emulated touch, and real
  touch — and a 450ms still-press picks the row up for a drag
  (haptic tick where supported, lifted-row styling); movement within
  the window cancels the press into a scroll. While a drag lives, a
  non-passive `touchmove` blocker keeps the browser from hijacking
  it into a pan; the row context menu is suppressed on mobile (the
  same long-press would otherwise open it), and read mode disables
  pickup, matching the desktop arm path.

  Mobile settings: a second renderer over the SAME
  `SETTING_METADATA` — entries opt in via a new `mobile: true` flag
  (default false, so editing/desktop settings can't leak in by
  omission); flagged: readers, default save format, layout choice,
  theme, display sizes (steppers), reduce motion, AI
  enable/key/model. One scrolling page with section headers rather
  than subpages (the flagged set is small). `SettingMeta` also gains
  `webOnly` (the desktop dialog and the command palette's settings
  search now both apply it, mirroring `electronOnly` — web-only rows
  can't surface in the desktop app's palette) and `searchHidden`
  (the layout setting is reachable from Settings and the mobile menu
  but stays out of command search). The desktop dialog gets a radio
  editor for the layout setting.

- **Web-edition Open could deadlock behind a hung picker**
  (`src/editor/host/browser-host.ts`). `openFile` serialized every
  call behind an in-flight promise; an `openOnce` that never settles
  — a dismissed picker on a browser without the `cancel` event, or
  an `input.click()` silently ignored because its transient user
  activation had expired — wedged the chain, killing every later
  Open across every entry point (they all share the host method). A
  new attempt now supersedes the pending one (settling it as null)
  instead of queueing behind it, so a single hung picker self-heals
  on the next try.

- **Mode-switch (three-pane ↔ windows) restores exactly the open
  set** (`src/editor/index.ts`, new `src/editor/mode-switch.ts`,
  `multi-pane-shell.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`, preload +
  electron-host). Primarily a macOS glitch — the trigger was the
  app outliving its windows, which only happens there (see the
  first hole below). The toggle works by journaling every open doc,
  reloading, and letting startup recovery reopen them in the new
  layout. Three holes in that handoff:

  - *Multi→single reopened nothing.* Single-doc boot gates startup
    recovery on `isFirstWindow()`, and main set `firstWindowId` once
    per app session, never reassigning it. On macOS the app stays
    alive after its last window closes, so any window created after
    that point — or surviving a switch that closed the original
    first window — was never "first" and silently skipped recovery;
    the journals just sat there. (On Linux/Windows the app quits
    with its last window, so every launch reset the id — which is
    why this direction only broke on the Mac.) The mode-switch
    reload now runs recovery in the surviving window regardless of
    first-window status (the sessionStorage marker identifies it
    precisely), and main lets the next created window reclaim
    firstness once the last window closes.

  - *Single→multi swept in stale docs.* The post-reload recovery
    auto-opened EVERY journal in the store, not just the ones this
    switch wrote — so leftovers from earlier sessions (including the
    failed multi→single direction above, which consumed nothing)
    reappeared on every toggle. The marker now carries the exact
    uid list the switch journaled: the initiating window's docs via
    sessionStorage, and the docs of the windows the switch closes
    via a main-process accumulator (`host:mode-switch-journaled` /
    `host:take-mode-switch-journaled` — sessionStorage is
    per-window, so a closing window's list can only travel through
    main). Recovery reopens exactly that set; unrelated journals
    stay put for the next normal launch's recovery sidebar, which
    is where crash leftovers belong.

  - *Every switch left bogus journals and dirty flags behind.* The
    switch journals clean docs too (the journal is the transport),
    but the reopen marked everything dirty and never deleted the
    consumed entries — breaking the journals-mean-unsaved-work
    invariant: clean docs came back prompting to save on close, and
    quitting after a switch resurfaced the whole workspace as
    recovery offers. The marker now records each doc's pre-switch
    dirty state; clean docs reopen clean and their journals are
    deleted once they're open (the on-disk file already matches),
    dirty docs reopen dirty with the journal kept. Spawned windows
    (multi→single distribution) get the flag via a new `markDirty`
    field on the spawn payload. A doc reported dirty by any channel
    stays dirty — losing an unsaved-changes flag is worse than a
    redundant prompt. The untouched onboarding starter is skipped
    entirely (it used to journal as a redundant "Untitled" that
    reopened as an extra pane).

  `[cardmirror] modeswitch:` diagnostics along the journal → marker
  → recovery path (forwarded to the dev terminal) for the
  verification loop, alongside the existing main-process `xlog`
  probes.

- **Typing over a block-tail selection preserves the boundary** (new
  `src/editor/type-over-boundary.ts`, wired in `buildEditorPlugins`).
  Triple-click selects a paragraph's inline content, so typing over it
  replaces in place; Ctrl-Shift-Down extends the selection to offset 0
  of the NEXT textblock, so the boundary sat inside the replace range
  and typing merged the blocks — cursor at a tag's start +
  Ctrl-Shift-Down + type folded the cite into the tag. A
  handleTextInput plugin intercepts text input over any non-empty
  selection whose tail sits at parentOffset 0 of a textblock with the
  head in an earlier block, and trims the replace range back to the
  end of the previous textblock (Selection.near walking backward
  across however many structural tokens separate the blocks — works
  for tag|cite inside a card as well as sibling paragraphs).
  Selections genuinely reaching INTO the next block's text are left
  to the standard merging behavior, as are IME composition and paste
  (out of scope: the reported gesture is plain typing).

- **Multi-pane word-count staleness after a pane move fixed**
  (`src/editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`). Full trace of the live counter,
  both modes: single-pane refreshes from (a) the heavy debounced flush
  on doc changes, (b) the selection-only branch under
  `liveSelectionWordCount`, (c) the settings subscriber, (d) initial
  mount/setActiveView. Multi-pane mirrors all four — but its (a) and
  (b) live in the per-record `dispatchTransaction`, which closed over
  the SLOT captured at `buildDocRecord` time. `sendVisibleToSlotByIndex`
  (the Send Doc to Slot commands) moves records between slots via
  `releaseVisible` + `push`, leaving that closure pointed at the old
  slot: every doc-changed flush and selection refresh then updated the
  WRONG pane's footer (a visual no-op there, masking the bug), so a
  moved speech doc's count froze — the reported symptom: Send to
  Speech in multi-pane didn't update the count until something else
  (any settings write → refresh-all, or a stack switch → mountVisible)
  repainted it. DocRecord now carries an `owner: Slot` backref that
  `Slot.push` re-points on every move, and both dispatch-path refresh
  sites use `record.owner` instead of the captured slot. Settings-
  change and mount paths were already parity-correct. THE ACTUAL
  reported bug sat one layer up (found by instrumenting the path
  after the owner fix didn't resolve it — the trace showed flushes
  scheduled but never completing): the shell's send-to-speech wrapper
  passes an afterInsert hook that CANCELLED the destination record's
  pending heavy-update timer ("so the new headings show up
  immediately") without performing the work the timer owed — the
  word-count refresh and full nav rebuild silently never ran, on
  every send. The cross-pane drag-drop handler had the same
  cancel-without-flush pattern. Both now call a shared
  `flushHeavyUpdateNow(record)` (cancel + nav update + word-count
  refresh, synchronously), so the count updates instantly on send —
  ahead of the 200ms debounce an ordinary edit gets. The console
  bridge also now forwards all error-level renderer output
  unconditionally; invisible exceptions in deferred callbacks were
  repeatedly the missing diagnostic.

- **Smart Shrink** (`src/editor/ribbon-commands.ts` `smartShrinkText`;
  ribbon `smartShrink`, Mod-Alt-8, grouped beside Shrink/Regrow).
  One-shot per-paragraph shrink depth: a block with no
  underline_mark / underline_direct / emphasis_mark anywhere goes
  straight to 5pt; blocks carrying those marks shrink their eligible
  text to 8pt. Deliberately deterministic (no AI). Scope mirrors the
  regular shrink cycle via a block-aware variant
  (`computeSmartShrinkBlocks`) — cursor in card/analytic → all its
  bodies, doc paragraph → itself, selection → clipped card_body/
  paragraph portions — with one wrinkle the cycle doesn't have:
  classification reads the WHOLE paragraph even when only part is
  selected (a partial selection in a marked paragraph shrinks to 8pt,
  not 5pt). Eligibility and the protected-span machinery
  (findProtectedRanges + restore-to-Normal under
  shrinkRestoresOmissionsToNormal) are shared with the cycle.
  Idempotent with honest no-op reporting: when every eligible range
  already sits at its target size the command returns false instead
  of burning an undo step. (`src/editor/ai/repair-text.ts`
  `applyPass`). The animated one-at-a-time walk (110ms cadence,
  per-fix flash + scroll) is replaced by one transaction per pass via
  `buildRepairTransaction`, with `setRepairFlashes` blinking every
  replacement range at once — the same presentation as Repair
  Formatting; the two passes read as two blinks. The walk's
  reduced-motion fallback became dead code and is removed (the batch
  path is what it collapsed to). Edits stay off-history with the
  single-undo collapse at the end, unchanged.

- **Repair Formatting (AI)** (new `src/editor/ai/repair-formatting.ts`;
  ribbon `repairFormatting`, Mod-Alt-R; wired in `index.ts` /
  `ribbon-groups.ts`). Normalizes imported body text to Verbatim's
  four-layer scheme (underline ⊇ emphasis; highlight ⊇ shading; bold /
  italic only as a deliberate extra layer or reproduced source
  formatting). Architecture deliberately differs from Repair Text's
  find/replace diffs: the model NEVER re-emits the card. The editor
  computes the card's distinct formatting SIGNATURES (the exact mark
  set per run, plus `du` for direct underline, `small` for
  below-base-size text, `cite` for cite-style debris) and sends the
  plain text plus a signature table with run counts and sample
  excerpts; the model returns a constant-size JSON mapping — signature
  → canonical target — plus optional verbatim-fragment exceptions for
  idiosyncratic spans (e.g. a book title keeping italics against the
  blanket italics→emphasis rule). `applyFormatPlan` rewrites each
  mapped run (scheme marks wholesale-replaced; identity mappings
  skipped so the transaction stays minimal), then applies exceptions
  over every occurrence of each fragment. Guarantees by construction:
  text untouchable (the model has no channel to change it), font sizes
  never modified (they encode shrink state and, in the size-recovery
  pattern, the only surviving underline evidence), highlight/shading
  colors carried over from the original runs. One request per card —
  card-scoped judgments like "is ALL underlining bold?" (which decides
  bold-underline → underline vs emphasis, per the Doc-Style-Cleaner
  heuristic) stay card-scoped; doc-level loose paragraphs pool as one
  group. Base size = largest size with ≥10% char share (largest, not
  modal: shrunk connective text is usually the majority in
  size-encoded cards). The pattern-3 discriminator — does the card
  have any plain (non-bold) underlining? — is computed by the editor
  and stated as a FACTS line in the request rather than left for the
  model to infer: a live all-bold-underline card was mapped b+u → em
  because the model failed to notice the ABSENCE of a bare-u
  signature (models reliably miss absences); the run loop also logs a
  WARNING when a plan contradicts the stated fact. Existing
  emphasis_mark is HARD-protected: a live size-recovery card's one
  emphasized sentence was bulldozed into the blanket plain→u rule, so
  a plan that strips em from an em-carrying signature gets em
  reinstated by the parser (u dropped, since em implies underline),
  with a logged WARNING — the exceptions channel remains the
  deliberate per-fragment override. Target parsing tolerates the
  signature notation the table teaches ("u+hl" splits to ["u","hl"]).
  All requests resolve before a SINGLE
  transaction applies every card (formatting-only edits keep positions
  stable), so the whole repair is one undo step; repaired ranges flash
  like Repair Text. [repair-fmt]-tagged console diagnostics log the
  signature table sent, the full plan and exceptions returned,
  unmapped signatures, dropped/invalid entries, and per-card rewrite
  counts — same refinement loop as [repair]; the main-process console
  forwarder now matches the [repair-fmt] tag too.

- **Repair JSON salvage: unescaped quotes no longer kill the
  response** (`src/editor/ai/repair-text.ts` `salvageJson`, shared by
  `repair-formatting.ts`). Live failure: the model echoed evidence
  containing quotation marks without escaping them inside the JSON
  strings — one missed escape made the whole reply unparseable
  ("Expected ',' or '}' after property value"). On a parse failure
  both parsers retry through a salvage pass that walks the string
  tracking inside-string state and escapes any interior quote not
  followed by a structural character (and folds literal newlines to
  \\n), logging when salvage was needed; the prompt also now tells the
  model explicitly to escape interior quotes. A second live failure —
  a complete JSON object followed by ANOTHER object or trailing prose
  ("unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON"; first-to-LAST-
  brace slicing poisoned the parse even though each piece was fine) —
  falls back to string-aware balanced-object extraction: each
  top-level {...} parses separately and the fixes arrays merge
  (formatting repair takes the first object carrying a map). Only when
  nothing parses does the original error surface.
  output cap raised; failure paths logged**
  (`src/editor/ai/repair-text.ts`, console forwarding in
  `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`). Live diagnosis on a real imported card
  (46 fixes returned, only 31 placed) showed the dominant
  "could not place" cause: the model echoes straight quotes/apostrophes
  in its `find` strings where the document has curly ones — every
  skipped fix in the log was a quoted span. Repro tests confirmed the
  full failure taxonomy: smart-punctuation echoes (dominant), inline
  pilcrows omitted from finds, overlapping context windows, and a
  flattenSelection block-boundary miss when duplicated blocks share a
  node object (copy/paste reuses nodes). Fixes: (1) when the verbatim
  search misses, a folded-space fallback retries — curly quotes/dashes
  → ASCII, ligatures (ﬀ ﬁ ﬂ ﬃ ﬄ) expanded, NBSP/tab/newline → space,
  soft-hyphen/zero-widths dropped (pilcrow deliberately NOT folded:
  it's meaningful content and a folded match spanning one would delete
  it) — and ONLY the differing middle of find→replace (the actual
  correction) is applied. The agreeing prefix/suffix are never edited,
  so the document keeps its punctuation and ligatures there, and the
  context may legitimately span a block boundary (a second live run
  showed the model writing a space where the doc has a newline);
  only an edit middle crossing a boundary is rejected — joining or
  splitting blocks from a non-verbatim match is too ambiguous.
  Middle-only edits can be pure deletions, so both apply sites guard
  the empty-replace case (insertText('') throws). VERBATIM matches
  also reduce to their middles before overlap resolution — fixes whose
  context windows overlap now coexist when their actual edits are
  disjoint (live: a detected "self- help" fix was dropped under
  another fix's context). Exact duplicates of an already-placed edit
  (the model lists one correction under two context wordings) drop
  SILENTLY — they're not losses, so they no longer inflate the
  "couldn't be placed" count in the toast; conflicting same-point
  insertions still count. The fold
  is also case-insensitive (live: the model echoed "in much of…" for a
  doc reading "In much of…" — safe because the agreeing context is
  never edited, so the doc keeps its case), and a LAST-RESORT trimmed
  retry handles word-level context misquotes (live: the model dropped
  "the" from "of the re sis tance literature"): whole context words
  are cut from the find's ends — within the agreeing prefix/suffix
  only, smallest trim first, minimum-needle-length guarded — and the
  shorter pair retried through the folded locator; the reading-order
  cursor keeps a less-unique needle honest. This also rescues "--"
  echoed for an em-dash when the corrupted word is trimmable context.
  Case folding applies to the SEARCH only: the find→replace diff is
  computed case-sensitively (the comparison is model-internal), so a
  fix whose whole point is a case change ("Of" → "of", live miss) is a
  real edit middle rather than folding away to a discarded no-op.
  Remaining pinned gap: a find that omits an inline pilcrow. (2) The
  reply cap rises
  4096→16K with stop_reason checked — a truncated fix list previously
  surfaced as an opaque "not valid JSON" error; now it's an actionable
  "repair a smaller region". (3) Every outcome logs a [repair]-tagged
  console line (per-pass placement summary, classified skips, errors),
  and the Electron main process forwards [repair]/[cardmirror]-tagged
  renderer console lines to stdout so terminal dev sessions can see
  them. (4) Detection: the prompt now names the
  stray-space-after-hyphen artifact explicitly with both resolutions —
  keep the hyphen for genuine compounds ("neo- Gramscian" →
  "neo-Gramscian"), drop it for ordinary words split across a line
  ("re- search" → "research"); the old prompt only covered line-break
  hyphenation, and the strict leave-it-if-uncertain guideline made the
  model skip mid-line hyphen-space errors entirely. Known remaining
  gaps (pinned in tests): omitted pilcrows, and the shared-node
  flatten boundary miss.

- **Anthropic translation output ceiling raised; truncation surfaced**
  (`src/editor/translate.ts`). `translateAnthropic` inherited the
  client's `DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS = 1024` — sized for chat replies, not
  translations, whose output is roughly input-sized. Anything past a
  few paragraphs came back with `stop_reason: 'max_tokens'`, which the
  translator ignored: the cut-off text was copied to the clipboard as
  if complete. Now: the translation call requests a 16K-token ceiling
  (output tokens only bill as generated, so the headroom is free on
  short selections; 16K stays within non-streaming HTTP comfort), and
  `stop_reason === 'max_tokens'` threads through `TranslateOutcome.
  truncated` — the toast warns, and the clipboard text itself gains a
  trailing `[TRANSLATION INCOMPLETE — OUTPUT LENGTH LIMIT REACHED]`
  line so the incomplete result can't be pasted without notice. Other
  AI features keep the 1024 chat default. The MyMemory/Google paths
  are unchanged (MyMemory chunks at its per-request cap and errors
  loudly on quota; neither silently truncates).

- **Cite-debris cleanup: shadow ranges skip the Layer-3 trim;
  classification ignores whitespace-only cite runs**
  (`src/editor/ribbon-commands.ts` `getOperatingRangesForFormatting` +
  `sizeCycleCommand`, `src/import/importer.ts` `hasCiteMark`,
  `src/editor/cite-classifier-plugin.ts`,
  `src/editor/similar-selection-plugin.ts` `computeSimilarMatches`).
  Real-doc case (burgum 18): a card body imported with its entire
  un-underlined text as 8pt runs carrying `cite_mark` — the original
  cut's condensed un-underlined text, cite-styled in the source docx,
  boundary spaces inside the runs. The failure chain: content-based
  classification (any cite_mark → cite_paragraph) typed the body as a
  cite line; shrink's scope only collects card_body/paragraph, so it
  silently no-opped; and the natural cleanup — Select Similar on the
  un-underlined text, then F12 — ALMOST worked: the matches were
  correct, but `getOperatingRangesForFormatting` applied the Layer-3
  trailing-space trim (built to undo double-click word-unit
  absorption, one selection at a time) to EACH of the ~55 matched run
  ranges, shaving one space per run. Those 55 still-cite-marked spaces
  kept the live classifier re-affirming cite_paragraph, so the
  paragraph stayed unshrinkable with no visible formatting left.
  Fixes: (1) shadow-selection ranges skip the Layer-3 trim — they're
  text-run-exact, nothing was absorbed; (2) both `hasCiteMark` sites
  skip whitespace-only runs, so space-only cite debris can't classify
  a paragraph (root cause — the doc now imports as card_body in the
  first place; the inverse suite pins it); (3) whitespace-only runs
  match Select Similar fingerprints on marks alone, size ignored —
  relevant when re-sampling already-cleaned text whose size no longer
  matches the debris; (4) shrink with the cursor in a cite_paragraph
  shows a toast naming the blocker instead of silently returning
  false. Existing .cmir files with debris reclassify on the first edit
  that touches the paragraph (the classifier is transaction-scoped).

- **Structural command with a selection inside a same-type head fixed**
  (`src/editor/ribbon-commands.ts` `applyStructuralToSelection` /
  `transformDocChild`). With a non-empty selection, F7 routed through
  the selection path, which marked the tag as "touched": the tag was
  re-wrapped as its own card, but every following card child was lifted
  to doc level — the cite_paragraph became a plain paragraph (losing
  the cite slot and styling) and the body detached from the card. The
  cursor path treats F7-in-a-tag as a no-op, so the two gestures
  disagreed destructively. Subtle in practice because the tag keeps its
  card wrapper — the visible symptoms are the cite losing its
  formatting and condense no longer folding the body. Fix: a child the
  command would re-create as the type it already is (tag under setTag,
  analytic under setAnalytic, undertag under setUndertag, matching
  heading under setPocket/Hat/Block) now counts as untouched, and a
  changed-content check makes a fully same-type selection return false
  instead of dispatching an identical replace (which burned an undo
  step and yanked the cursor). The deliberate split semantics —
  selection in a card_body splits a new card; multi-paragraph
  selections wrap each paragraph — are unchanged. Known residual
  asymmetry: a CROSS-type selection on a head (F7 with analytic text
  selected) still converts only the head where the cursor path converts
  the whole unit; recorded in the audit doc.

- **NavigationPanel leak on doc close fixed** (`src/editor/nav-panel.ts`,
  `src/editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`). The multi-pane shell creates one
  NavigationPanel per open doc; closing a doc destroyed the EditorView
  and detached the drag surface but never the panel. The panel's
  constructor-time `settings.subscribe` and attach-time
  `dragController.subscribe`/`registerSurface` closures therefore kept
  the panel reachable for the whole session — pinning `currentDoc` (a
  full ProseMirror doc snapshot, MBs for a real file) and the rendered
  `liEntries` map, and the leaked drag subscriber kept running
  hover/auto-expand hit-testing on every drag move event. New
  `NavigationPanel.destroy()` releases all three subscriptions, removes
  the document-level drag listeners (covers closing mid-drag), cancels
  the auto-expand/auto-restore timers, clears the entry map, nulls
  doc/view, and removes the root element; both shell close paths call
  it beside `view.destroy()`. A `destroyed` flag turns any late
  debounced `update()` into a no-op so a straggler can't re-pin the
  snapshot the destroy just released.

- **Global hotkey fallback case-folding fixed**
  (`src/editor/ribbon-commands.ts` `ribbonKeyStringFor` /
  `ribbonCommandForKey`). The window-level keydown fallback (the path
  that fires when focus is on the ribbon/nav/chrome rather than the
  editor) built its lookup string from `e.key` verbatim — but a real
  Shift or CapsLock keydown produces an uppercase letter ('S'), while
  bindings are registered lowercase ('Mod-Shift-s'), so every letter
  chord missed and the browser default fired instead. Inside the
  editor prosemirror-keymap normalizes case, which is why the same
  shortcuts worked there. `ribbonKeyStringFor` now folds
  single-character keys to lowercase, and `ribbonCommandForKey` folds
  both sides of the comparison — necessary because the keybindings
  editor captured overrides through the unfolded path, so a user's
  saved `Mod-Shift-Y` must keep matching after the fix.

- **Find/Replace offset corruption after inline images fixed**
  (`src/editor/find-replace-plugin.ts` `findMatches`,
  `src/editor/find-replace-ui.ts` `buildSnippet`). Match positions were
  computed as character offsets into each textblock's `textContent` —
  but inline image atoms occupy one document position while contributing
  zero characters, so every match after an image sat one position left
  per preceding image: decorations misaligned, snippets sliced wrong,
  and Replace edited a shifted range (corrupting the neighboring text).
  Both sites now scan `textBetween` with a one-character leaf
  placeholder, which keeps string offsets identical to document
  positions. The scan uses `U+0000` (impossible in a query, so a match
  can never span an image — correct, since there IS an image between
  those words); the snippet uses U+FFFC so an image shows as the
  standard object-replacement glyph in find results.

- **Undertag italic round-trip fixed** (`src/import/importer.ts`,
  `parseRPr`). The exporter dual-encodes `undertag_mark` as
  rStyle="UndertagChar" + `<w:i/>` (the style implies italic display in
  Word — same parity precedent as underline's `<w:u/>`), but the
  importer mapped `w:i` → italic unconditionally, so one save/open
  cycle added a real italic mark to every undertag run. `w:i` is now
  deferred to the end of the rPr scan (OOXML guarantees no order
  between rStyle and run properties, the same reason `w:u` defers) and
  swallowed when `undertag_mark` is present. Consequence, accepted: a
  *user-applied* italic on undertag text is lost on round-trip — the
  exporter emits byte-identical runs for undertag and undertag+italic,
  so no inverse can distinguish them, and rendering is identical either
  way (the style already displays italic). This mirrors underline's
  long-standing dual-encoding trade.

## 0.1.0-alpha.10 — 2026-06-08

- **Reading-position marker** (`src/editor/reading-marker.ts`, read-mode
  wiring in `src/editor/read-mode-plugin.ts`, ribbon `toggleReadingMarker`).
  Inserts a red text run `Marked h:mm` (the `font_color` mark at `FF0000`,
  Verbatim's red-text convention) at the cursor and places the caret after
  it; the inclusive red mark is stripped from stored marks so it doesn't
  bleed into the next typing. Toggling: `readingMarkerRunAt` detects when
  the cursor sits on (or at either edge of) an existing red run — expanded
  over adjacent marker text nodes — and the command deletes it instead of
  inserting. Round-trips to Word as a normal colored run.
  - **Own undo step.** Both the insert and delete paths call
    `closeHistory(tr)` so each marker is isolated in history — never grouped
    (PM's `newGroupDelay` / adjacency) with a nearby edit, which would make
    undoing the marker also revert that edit.
  - **Read-mode integration.** Read mode now keeps the editor `editable`
    (caret placeable) and blocks edits via `filterTransaction`, which lets
    through only transactions flagged `READING_MARKER_META` or
    `READ_MODE_UNDO_META`. A `handleDOMEvents.keydown` handler (fires even
    though keymaps don't, under `editable: false` historically — now under
    the filter) maps bare Space/Enter to the toggle. The plugin's
    `isReadKept` keeps red marker text visible in read mode.
  - **Undo bounded to markers.** On read-mode entry the plugin snapshots
    `baseUndoDepth`; `readModeAwareUndo` (Mod-Z) only undoes while the depth
    exceeds it, so undo can't reach edits made before read mode.
    `readModeAwareRedo` (Mod-Y / Mod-Shift-Z) is gated on a `dirtied` flag
    set by a marker edit, so redo only re-applies undone markers. Both tag
    their transactions `READ_MODE_UNDO_META` to pass the filter.

- **Slanted caret for pending italic** (`src/editor/italic-caret-plugin.ts`).
  Browsers can't slant the native caret, so when a collapsed cursor's
  effective marks (`storedMarks ?? $from.marks()`) include `italic`, the
  plugin hides the native caret (`.pmd-italic-caret-active` →
  `caret-color: transparent`) and draws a thin `position: fixed`, skewed,
  blinking caret at `coordsAtPos(head)`, repositioned on selection / scroll
  (capture) / resize / focus. Reduced motion → static slanted caret.

- **Mod-U decoupled from F9 for the collapsed-cursor case**
  (`src/editor/ribbon-commands.ts`). New `toggleUnderlineTyping` command,
  default-bound to `Mod-u` (F9 keeps `applyUnderline`). With a selection or
  shadow ranges it delegates to `applyUnderline`; on a collapsed cursor it
  toggles a STORED underline mark (parity with Mod-I/Mod-B) instead of F9's
  expand-to-word-and-underline — `underline_direct` in structural blocks,
  the named `underline_mark` in body. `applyUnderline`'s default keys drop
  `Mod-u` (now `['F9']`).

- **Repair Text** (`src/editor/ai/repair-text.ts`,
  `src/editor/repair-highlight-plugin.ts`, ribbon wiring). Diff-based OCR /
  PDF repair: the model returns `{ fixes: [{ find, replace }] }` (verbatim
  substrings + corrections) instead of a full rewrite — less hallucination
  surface, fewer output tokens. `flattenSelection` flattens the selection
  to text with `\n` between blocks (so paragraph boundaries aren't read as
  run-together words) plus a char→PM-position map; `locateFixes` finds each
  `find` sequentially and maps it to a doc range (a cross-block range joins
  on apply, repairing hyphenation split across lines).
  - **Two passes** at `temperature: 0` (new `temperature` option on
    `callAnthropic`): the model occasionally skips a token on one read, so
    a second pass over the corrected text catches it. Pass 2 is skipped
    when pass 1 found nothing.
  - **Animation**: each fix is applied as its own off-history transaction
    (sequential text replacement, orange flash via `repairHighlightPlugin`,
    scroll-into-view, ~110ms cadence); the Clod/"Thinking…" tooltip stays
    anchored where it spawned. Reduced-motion collapses to an instant apply
    + one static highlight.
  - **Single undo**: because PM groups history by time + range adjacency,
    scattered fixes across two passes can't merge naturally — so
    `collapseToSingleUndo` reverts to the pre-repair doc (off-history) and
    re-applies the corrected content in two synchronous dispatches (no
    intermediate paint), recording the whole repair as ONE undoable change.

- **Translator** (`src/editor/translate.ts`, `src/editor/settings.ts`,
  `src/editor/settings-ui.ts`, ribbon wiring). Mirror of the "Card
  Formatting Tools" Translator. `runTranslate` reads the selection,
  translates via the resolved backend, and copies the result to the
  clipboard (no doc edit). Backends:
  - **MyMemory** — keyless, CORS-OK (renderer fetch), works with AI off.
    Needs a concrete source language; MyMemory's own auto-detect is
    unreliable, so on `'auto'` we detect locally with `tinyld` (new dep)
    first. Per-request `q` is capped, so text is chunked at sentence
    boundaries (`chunkText`) and rejoined. Optional `myMemoryEmail` raises
    the daily limit.
  - **Anthropic** — reuses the reference Translator prompt (parameterized
    by target language); only when AI features are ready.
  - **Google Cloud Translation** v2 — `googleTranslateApiKey`; auto-detects
    source.
  - `translationProvider` `'auto'` resolves to Anthropic when ready else
    MyMemory. `translationSourceLang` / `translationTargetLang` (default
    `en`) pickers. All under Settings → Editing via a custom
    `translationConfig` widget; the Anthropic radio greys out when AI is
    off (live, via a self-detaching `settings.subscribe`).
  - `prependTranslationMarker` (default **on**): prepends
    `<delim>TRANSLATION BY <attr><close>` to the clipboard output, where
    `<attr>` is the model (`modelMarkerName`), `MYMEMORY`, or
    `GOOGLE TRANSLATE`, wrapped in the `condenseWarningDelimiter` (custom
    condense delimiter → square-bracket fallback, since condense's custom
    is full pause/resume strings, not an open/close pair). Six
    `TRANSLATION BY .*?` shapes added to `BUILTIN_PROTECTED_REGEXES` so all
    attributions/delimiters survive Shrink.
  - `googleTranslateApiKey` + `myMemoryEmail` join `anthropicApiKey` in a
    new `SECRET_SETTING_KEYS` set — excluded from settings export, never
    overwritten on import.

- **Unified AI model + override + retired-model message**
  (`src/editor/ai/anthropic.ts`, `src/editor/settings.ts`). `DEFAULT_MODEL`
  is documented as the single source of truth; new `resolveAiModel()`
  returns the user's `aiModelOverride` when it passes a loose id check,
  else the default. `callAnthropic` calls it when no explicit model is
  passed, so every feature (cite, explain, translate, flashcards, image)
  honors the override at once. New Settings → Comments & AI → "AI model
  (advanced)" text field (greys with the AI master switch). On a 404 /
  `not_found_error` / model-naming 4xx, `callAnthropic` throws a friendly
  `'model'`-kind error telling the user to update or set a newer model id.

- **AI cite creator: off-by-one on whole-document selections + cite
  sanitization** (`src/editor/ai/cite-creator.ts`). Two fixes:
  - `buildCiteTransaction` now clamps the incoming range to valid text
    positions with `TextSelection.between(state.doc.resolve(from),
    state.doc.resolve(to))` before inserting. The caller passes the raw
    selection bounds; a whole-document / top-of-doc selection (Ctrl+A) has
    `from === 0`, which is a block-boundary position, not inline — PM lands
    the cite at position 1, but the old code computed the cite-mark range
    AND the "cite is its own paragraph" split from the raw `from`, shifting
    every position one left. Result: the trailing token lost its last char
    (`" Cary 2"` instead of `Cary 24`) and the cite's last char was shunted
    to its own line — together, since both derive from the same anchor.
    Clamping (e.g. `0 → 1`, or `0 → 2` when the doc starts with a card)
    makes the inserted run exactly `[from, from + cite.length]` again.
  - `parseCiteResponse` now runs cite and tokens through `sanitizeCiteText`
    (strip zero-width / format / control characters, collapse every
    whitespace run incl. newlines to a single space). Messy source (often
    PDF-pasted) makes the model echo invisibles or wrap the cite across
    lines; under `white-space: pre-wrap` a stray `\n` renders as a real
    line break, and a wrap inside the author block stops the token from
    substring-matching. Tokens get the same treatment (left-trimmed,
    trailing space preserved for the two-author `"X & "` convention) so
    `indexOf` still matches.

- **Gesture zoom — pinch / Ctrl+wheel** (`src/editor/index.ts`,
  `src/editor/settings.ts`). A `window` `wheel` listener (capture,
  non-passive) intercepts events with `ctrlKey` set — Chromium delivers a
  trackpad pinch as exactly that, so one handler covers pinch AND
  Ctrl+mouse-wheel. It `preventDefault`s (otherwise Chromium also fires
  its own native page-zoom → double zoom), accumulates `deltaY`, and steps
  `zoomPct` ±10% per ~40 delta-units via the existing `setZoom` (so the
  gesture round-trips through settings and the multi-pane shell like the
  buttons / `Mod-=` chords). Gated on the new `gestureZoom` setting
  (default **false**); drives the document zoom, not chrome scale.

- **Keyboard macros surfaced in the Search Everything palette**
  (`src/editor/quick-card-search-ui.ts`, `src/editor/keybindings-editor.ts`).
  The macros editor lives inside the keybindings editor (the
  `ribbonKeyOverrides` row, Settings → Shortcuts) rather than as its own
  `SETTING_METADATA` row, so it had no auto-generated palette entry. Added
  an explicit result (same pattern as the "About this install" special)
  matched on `keyboard macros` / `macro` / `snippet` / `text expansion`,
  deep-linking via `settingsTarget: {category:'shortcuts',
  anchor:'keyboard-macros'}`; the macros `<section>` now carries
  `data-anchor="keyboard-macros"` for `revealAnchor` to scroll/flash. Also
  added a `gesture zoom` alias to the `gestureZoom` setting.

- **Removed the `enableTextDragDrop` setting** (`src/editor/settings.ts`,
  `src/editor/index.ts`). The toggle was off by default (PM's native
  text-move drag produced un-cleanly-undoable edits) and the feature never
  worked reliably, so the setting is gone entirely (interface field,
  default, metadata, sanitize). The `dragstart`-swallowing plugin now
  `preventDefault`s unconditionally — same behavior as the old default-off
  state. The card / heading pickup-drag (pointerdown-driven) is unaffected.

- **Show-in-context closes the launching Manage overlay**
  (`src/editor/learn-session-ui.ts`, `src/editor/learn-manage-ui.ts`).
  `openLearnSession` gained an `onShowInContext` callback; the Manage
  screen passes its `cleanup`, and the session invokes it (alongside its
  own cleanup) only when `showFlashcardInContext` opens the source in
  THIS window — the same in-window path that already hides the home
  screen. Cases that open the card in a separate window leave the session
  and Manage overlay up.

- **Manage Flashcards ribbon button + due-today dot** (`index.html`,
  `src/editor/index.ts`, `src/editor/settings.ts`, `src/editor/style.css`).
  Added a `manage-flashcards-btn` to the comments cluster (the 2×3 grid's
  second row is now `manage-flashcards · create-flashcard · ask-ai`),
  wired to the existing `manageFlashcards` command. A red dot
  (`.pmd-ribbon-due-dot` ::after) shows when
  `learnStore.dueCount({kind:'all'}, localToday()) > 0` and the new
  `flashcardDueDot` setting (default true) is on; `refreshFlashcardDueDot`
  recomputes on `learnStore.subscribe`, the settings subscriber (toggle),
  and `visibilitychange` (catches a day-rollover while idle).

- **Backspace on an empty first-body slot deletes the blank line**
  (`src/editor/tag-keymap.ts`). `backspaceAtFirstBodyStart` swallowed
  Backspace at the start of a card/analytic_unit's first body whenever
  the head was non-empty (the anti-collision rule). Added an exception:
  when that body is itself empty (`content.size === 0`) there's nothing
  to collide, so delete the empty paragraph and place the cursor at the
  end of the head. Non-empty bodies still no-op. (`card`/`analytic_unit`
  content is `head (…)*`, so dropping the only body is schema-valid.)

- **`selectCurrentHeading` default-bound to `Alt-a`** (`ribbon-commands.ts`
  `DEFAULT_RIBBON_KEYS`). The command existed but shipped unbound (`''`);
  no conflict with existing defaults. User-rebindable via
  `ribbonKeyOverrides`.

- **Drag-from-editor auto-scroll fixed** (`src/editor/drag-editor-surface.ts`).
  `maybeAutoScroll` scrolled `this.host`, but the host (`#editor` /
  `.pmd-pane-editor`) isn't the scroll container — `#app` is in single-doc,
  the pane body in multi-pane — so it was a no-op and the edge test never
  fired (the host's full-height rect has its bottom far below the
  viewport). Now scrolls `findScrollGate()` (the same element `hitTest`
  gates on). (A companion fix — suppressing the text selection the pickup
  chord's Shift/Alt triggers on click, via a capture-phase pointerdown
  interceptor + `user-select: none` in pickup mode — is in the code but
  held out of the changelog pending macOS verification.)

- **`@AI` mentions fire from comments + notes again; AI author name
  cleaned up** (`src/editor/comments-ui.ts`). The `@AI` / has-AI-history
  re-invocation check lived only in `submitReply`, so it was lost on the
  comment thread's first message (`commitRootText`) and was never wired
  for notes (`addNoteComment`). Extracted into `maybeInvokeAiForComment`
  (called from the root input and replies) and added `maybeInvokeAiForNote`;
  `invokeAiLocal` / `contextFromLocal` are generalized over `'ai' | 'note'`
  so a note's AI reply lands as a private `ai: true` turn (with the
  Thinking placeholder + a re-render-signature flag added to notes). The
  redundant ` (AI)` author suffix is dropped — AI comments now store the
  plain persona name and rely on `initials: 'AI'` for round-trip
  detection (it survives via comments.xml `w:initials`); a legacy trailing
  `(AI)` is stripped at display and still recognized by `isAiComment`.

- **Annotations (comment / note / ask-AI) work on images** (`learn-anchor.ts`,
  `comments-plugin.ts`, `comments-ui.ts`, `ai/explain-context.ts`,
  `ai/anthropic.ts`, `ai/image-ai.ts`, `import/importer.ts`, `index.ts`).
  Previously all three silently failed on a picture (orphaned comment /
  empty-quote note / unanchored AI). Now:
  - *Anchoring (notes + AI).* `flatten()` emits a sentinel per image —
    object-replacement char + a cheap FNV-1a fingerprint of its base64
    data — so an image is one token in the flattened text stream. The
    existing quote/prefix/suffix matcher then handles image-only and mixed
    selections unchanged: re-anchors by content (not position), with
    different images distinguished by fingerprint and identical copies
    disambiguated by surrounding context, like a repeated phrase.
  - *Comments.* A `comment_range` mark already applies to an image (inline
    atom, no `marks` restriction); the only gap was that the live-thread
    scans walked text nodes only. `collectRanges`, `collectLiveThreadIds`
    (the GC), and the delete-strip now also read marks off `image` nodes.
    Round-trip: the docx exporter already brackets images
    (`exporter.ts:416`); fixed the importer to re-apply open comment
    ranges to imported images (cmir round-trips natively as PM JSON).
  - *Ask AI sends the image.* `ExplainContext` gains `images` (vision-
    supported formats only, document order, capped at 5);
    `formatExplainFirstTurn` prepends `image` content blocks before the
    text prompt (Anthropic's recommended order), and both AI paths
    (`invokeAi`, `invokeAiLocal`) use it. `buildExplainContext` allows an
    image-only selection (empty text + images). `aiAskAboutSelection`
    toasts when the selection has >5 images. Vision media-type set
    promoted to a shared `VISION_MEDIA_TYPES` in `anthropic.ts`.

- **Editor spellcheck: a custom viewport-scoped checker** (new
  `src/editor/viewport-spellcheck.ts`, `src/editor/proto-dict/`, `nspell`
  dep; `src/editor/index.ts`, `src/editor/multi-pane-shell.ts`,
  `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`). The `editorSpellcheck` setting is now
  served by a ProseMirror decoration plugin instead of the browser's
  built-in checker. Why the switch: the built-in checker only flags words
  as you *type* them (never text in opened/imported files), needed the
  Electron session engine enabled + a language set to work at all on
  Windows/Linux, and — decisively — does not paint squiggles under native
  Wayland. The custom checker fixes all three.
  - *How it works.* On scroll/edit (trailing-debounced ~120ms), it
    hit-tests the viewport top/bottom to find the on-screen doc range,
    tokenizes only that range, and decorates misspellings
    (`.pmd-misspelled`, a CSS wavy underline that renders everywhere
    incl. Wayland). Cost tracks words-on-screen, not document size; word
    verdicts are memoized. Gated on `editorSpellcheck` (no work, and no
    dictionary load, when off). Lands via `buildEditorPlugins`, so it
    covers both single-doc and multi-pane.
  - *Dictionary.* nspell (Hunspell-in-JS) over the en `.aff`/`.dic`
    (vendored under `proto-dict/`), **dynamically imported** so the
    ~550KB dictionary is a separate async chunk fetched only the first
    time spellcheck is turned on — a spellcheck-off session never pays
    for it. Build is ~67ms (one-time).
  - *Native checker disabled.* The editable's `spellcheck` attribute is
    now always `false`; the prior native-engine wiring
    (`setupSpellChecker`, `webPreferences.spellcheck`, the
    `editor-spellcheck.ts` focus-bounce) is removed.
  - *Right-click menu.* A `contextmenu` handler on a flagged word (falls
    through otherwise, so links/images/default menus still win) shows up
    to 7 `nspell.suggest` results (click to replace), **Add to
    Dictionary** (persisted to `localStorage['pmd-user-dictionary']`,
    re-applied via `nspell.add` on load — so it also drops from
    suggestions), and **Ignore** (session-only suppression). Word
    verdicts are memoized; the cache is invalidated on add. Menu reuses
    the `.pmd-nav-context-menu` styling.
  - *Not yet done*: a Web Worker for the one-time dictionary build (the
    user accepted the ~67ms hitch for now).
- **Suppress the auto-update-in-progress messaging on macOS**
  (`apps/desktop/src/main.ts`, `src/editor/settings-ui.ts`). Unsigned
  macOS builds can't self-install via Squirrel.Mac, so the auto-updater
  could detect a new version but the download/install never landed —
  while the UI still promised a background download and a restart-to-
  install. Detection stays on; on `darwin` we now set
  `autoUpdater.autoDownload = false` and `autoInstallOnAppQuit = false`,
  skip registering the `update-downloaded` "restart to install" dialog,
  and reword the "Update available" dialog detail + the Settings
  "Check for updates" toast to send the user to the `.dmg` instead of
  claiming a background download. Windows/Linux behavior is unchanged
  (still full auto-download + install-on-quit). Pairs with the README
  note that macOS updates are manual.

- **macOS cross-window bugs fixed: Finder-open duplicate guard + the
  multi-window three-pane toggle storm** (`apps/desktop/src/main.ts`,
  `src/editor/settings.ts`, `src/editor/index.ts`). Both were pinned down
  from the temporary `cross-window-debug.log` probe.
  - *Duplicate-open guard.* The OS-open path (`openExternalFile` — macOS
    `open-file`, Windows/Linux argv) spawned a window and registered the
    path WITHOUT the dedup check the in-app Open dialog runs through
    `host:open-path-check`, so a Finder double-click of an already-open
    file opened a second copy — and closing either copy then released the
    shared `openPathOwners` claim, orphaning the other. Not a path-
    canonicalization hole (the probe's `pathForensics` were clean: empty
    `nearMisses`, matching NFC/NFD, no realpath divergence) — a missing
    call site. Fix: a shared `focusExistingOwner(p, excludeWinId?)`
    helper focuses the owning window (pruning stale entries);
    `openExternalFile` calls it before spawning, and `host:open-path-
    check` now delegates to it.
  - *Three-pane toggle.* `multiDocWorkspace` is a synced (non-transient)
    setting, so toggling it in one window fired the `storage` event in
    every OTHER window, and each ran `handleModeSwitch` independently —
    two overlapping close rounds whose senders were each other's
    targets, so both windows closed and none survived to host the new
    layout (the backgrounded window also took ~9 s to answer its
    please-close, which read as "nothing happened" and prompted the
    second toggle). Fix: `notify()` passes a `{ remote }` origin flag to
    subscribers (true when the change arrived via the storage event); the
    mode-switch subscriber ignores remote changes, so only the
    initiating window drives the switch. A `modeSwitchInProgress`
    re-entrancy guard in `host:journal-and-close-other-windows` is the
    backstop.
  The temporary instrumentation stays in this build so the next capture
  can confirm the fix; it'll be removed once verified.

## 0.1.0-alpha.9 — 2026-06-03

- **Autosave toggle persists per document across close + reopen**
  (`autosave-prefs-store.ts` new, `index.ts`, `multi-pane-shell.ts`,
  `settings.ts`). `autosaveEnabled` stays a transient per-window setting
  (still in `TRANSIENT_SETTING_KEYS`, never written to `pmd-settings`),
  but the choice is now mirrored PER FILE PATH in a tiny localStorage
  store (`pmd-autosave-paths`, a set of ON paths; absence = off).
  - Single-pane: the `toggleAutosave` ctx handler writes
    `setAutosaveForPath(activeFile().handle, next)`; both open paths
    (`routeOpenedFile`, `loadFileInPlace`) restore via
    `settings.set('autosaveEnabled', isAutosaveOnForPath(handle))` right
    after setting the handle/format.
  - Multi-pane: `DocRecord` init reads `isAutosaveOnForPath(opts.handle)`
    instead of hard `false`; `toggleFocusedAutosave` persists the flip.
  - Only Electron string-path docs key into the store; web
    `FileSystemFileHandle`s and unsaved docs no-op (stay default-off).
    Save-As to a new path doesn't retro-persist (the in-session flag is
    untouched; the new path remembers once toggled) — a minor edge, not
    the close/reopen case this targets.

- **Cross-window diagnostic instrumentation (TEMPORARY, macOS bug
  hunt)** (`apps/desktop/src/main.ts`, `preload.ts`,
  `src/editor/host/electron-host.ts`, `src/editor/index.ts`). Logging
  only — no behavior change, and deliberately NOT disabling native
  window occlusion so the bugs still reproduce. Targets two Mac-only,
  Windows/Linux-fine symptoms suspected of a shared cause: the
  duplicate-open guard missing, and the three-pane toggle's
  close/reopen being flaky (send-to-speech, which only pushes to one
  live window, works). All three use the same main-process IPC, so the
  differentiator is what each needs a *non-foreground* window to do.
  Writes one JSON line per event to `{userData}/cross-window-debug.log`
  (and console) via an `xlog` helper; a renderer→main `host:debug-log`
  bridge (`ElectronHost.debugLog`) folds renderer events into the same
  clock. Captured:
  - **Dedup canonicalization** — `canonicalOpenPath` is just
    `path.resolve` (no case-fold, no Unicode NFC/NFD normalization, no
    `/private`/`/Volumes` symlink resolution). Each
    check/register/release logs `pathForensics` (resolved key, isNFC/
    isNFD, `realpathSync.native`, realDiffers) and, on a missed check,
    `dedupeNearMisses` — registered keys that point at the SAME file
    under a DIFFERENT string (sameNFC / sameLower / sameReal). A hit
    there is direct proof of the canonicalization hole.
  - **Mode-switch close** — `host:journal-and-close-other-windows` logs
    each other window's visible/minimized/focused state, then per
    window `closed-clean` vs `destroyed-timeout` + elapsed ms (the
    10s `destroy()` skips the renderer's journal → lost doc =
    "flaky"). `host:close-self` logs `modeSwitchWakeMs` (please-close
    send → close-self arrival = the background renderer's wake+journal
    latency). Renderer logs `please-close-received` with
    `document.visibilityState` (`hidden` ⇒ occluded) and
    `please-close-journaled` with journal ms.
  - **Renderer freeze / occlusion** — per-window `wc-unresponsive`/
    `wc-responsive` and `win-blur`/`focus`/`hide`/`show`; `setdochandle`
    logs the owning window's visibility at path (re)register; a `boot`
    header records platform / Electron / Chromium versions + log path.

- **Word Count Selection button per pane in multi-pane mode**
  (`multi-pane-shell.ts`). The single-pane status bar's Σ button
  (`#word-count-btn`, hidden in multi-doc mode) had no equivalent in the
  pane footers. Each `Slot` footer now builds a `.pmd-pane-wc-btn` before
  the `.pmd-pane-wc` readout; its click focuses the slot
  (`shell.focusSlot`) and calls `openWordCount(this.visible.view)` —
  scoping the modal to that pane's own visible doc and selection rather
  than the module-level single-pane `view`. `mousedown` is
  preventDefault'd and the click `stopPropagation`'d like the sibling
  open-file button; it no-ops when the slot is empty. Styled in
  `style.css` like `.status-bar-btn`, scaled to the footer. The shared
  status-bar Σ button (`#word-count-btn`) is now also hidden in
  multi-doc mode (alongside the already-hidden `#word-count-display`) —
  it otherwise sat in the corner below the nav rail and was redundant
  with the per-pane buttons.

- **Live selection word count had no effect in multi-pane mode**
  (`multi-pane-shell.ts`). Two gaps vs. single-pane: (1) the per-pane
  `dispatchTransaction` called `slot.refreshWordCount()` only inside
  `if (tx.docChanged)`, so selection-only transactions never refreshed
  the footer — the "Sel:" readout only appeared after the next edit,
  looking permanently off. Added an `else if` mirroring single-pane's
  `index.ts` gate (`liveSelectionWordCount` on, selection changed, and a
  range on either side so empty→empty cursor moves do nothing). (2)
  `Slot.refreshWordCount` computed `hasSel = !sel.empty` WITHOUT checking
  the setting, so when it did run with a selection it showed the
  selection count regardless of the toggle; now gated on
  `settings.get('liveSelectionWordCount') && !sel.empty` like single-pane
  `refreshWordCount`. The settings-toggle path was already covered — the
  shell's settings subscriber refreshes every slot's word count on any
  change.

- **Dropzone pill stranded over the pane footer on multi-pane boot**
  (`index.ts`, `style.css`). The floating dropzone pill anchors to the
  leftmost VISIBLE pane body via `positionDropzone`, but multi-pane has
  TWO stacked bottom bars — the per-pane `.pmd-pane-footer` (word count
  + Σ) sits on top of the still-visible full-width `#status-bar`. Three
  things conspired: (1) the boot `requestAnimationFrame(positionDropzone)`
  runs in single-pane context (`#app` still visible, `pmd-multi-doc` not
  yet set) and INLINES a `bottom` measured against `#app` — clearing the
  status bar but not the footer; (2) the later multi-doc pass early-
  returns because panes boot `[hidden]` (no `.pmd-pane:not([hidden])
  .pmd-pane-body` anchor exists yet), leaving that stale inline value in
  place; (3) the `#app` `ResizeObserver` wired at boot is dead in
  multi-doc (`#app` is `display:none`), so nothing re-ran the pass when a
  pane un-hid on doc-load — only an unrelated reflow (cycling the theme)
  did. Fixes: a `body.pmd-multi-doc .pmd-dropzone-root` CSS fallback that
  clears BOTH bars (`calc(var(--status-bar-height) +
  var(--pmd-pane-footer-height) + 0.5rem)`, the footer height now a
  shared `:root` var so it can't drift from `.pmd-pane-footer`'s
  `min-height`); `positionDropzone` now REMOVES its inline `left` /
  `bottom` / `max-width` when it can't measure the anchor, so the mode-
  aware CSS fallback applies instead of a stale single-pane value; and a
  `ResizeObserver` + a `hidden`-attribute `MutationObserver` on
  `.pmd-multi-row` so the pass re-runs (and inlines the exact position)
  the moment a pane un-hides as its first doc mounts.

- **Version / "About this install" in the command palette.** A synthetic
  settings result in `searchSettingsSource` (`quick-card-search-ui.ts`),
  prepended when the query prefix-matches "version" / "about" / "about
  this install" / "release". Its name shows `CardMirror <appVersion>`
  (`appVersion` newly exported from `install-info.ts`), and it carries
  `settingsTarget: { category: 'general', anchor: 'about-this-install' }`.
  `SettingsTarget` gains an `anchor` field; `SettingsModal.open` handles
  it via a new `revealAnchor` that scrolls + flashes the `[data-anchor]`
  section (the About block, now tagged `data-anchor="about-this-install"`)
  — reusing the existing settings-search deep-link piping.

- **Settings open + change performance on large docs.** Several
  settings-subscriber paths did O(doc) work on every change (and at open):
  - `buildColorOverridesEditor` (`settings-ui.ts`) was the dominant cost:
    each of ~37 color rows ran `getComputedStyle` — via `currentValue`
    (`getComputedStyle(documentElement)`) and `parseToRgbaParts`, which
    **appended + removed a probe `<span>` to `<body>` per call** — on
    every settings change, forcing a full-document style recalc each time
    (read/write thrash × 37). Now: one persistent off-screen probe reused
    across calls (no per-call append/remove), and each row subscribes only
    to ITS OWN token (`displayColors[dcKey]` or `customColorOverrides[name]`)
    so editing one color refreshes one row, not all 37.
  - The global apply subscriber (`index.ts`) called `applyReadMode` on
    every change, which dispatches a transaction that makes the read-mode
    plugin re-walk the doc to rebuild hiding decorations — now guarded on
    `readMode` / `hideEmphasisBordersInReadMode` actually changing.
  - The nav/outline panel (`nav-panel.ts`) rebuilt the whole outline (one
    node per heading) on every settings change — now only when `navMaxLevel`
    or `showCitePreview` changes.
  - The apply subscriber's `refreshWordCount()` walked the whole doc on
    every change; now `refreshWordCount({ selectionOnly: true })` reuses
    the cached whole-doc count (the doc is unchanged on a settings toggle).
  - The Keyboard tab's ~150-row keybindings list is built on the next
    frame (`requestAnimationFrame`) rather than blocking the dialog open
    (it's not the default tab, and its panel starts hidden).

- **Convert Cited Analytics to Tags command.** New bindable command
  `convertCitedAnalyticsToTags` (`ribbon-commands.ts`, label "Convert
  Cited Analytics to Tags", no default key, Cleanup group, doc-dropdown
  Cleanup section). The existing `convertAnalyticsToTags` body was
  extracted into a shared `analyticsToTagsCommand(shouldConvert)` helper:
  the original passes `() => true`, the new one passes a predicate that
  checks the `analytic_unit` has a `cite_paragraph` child. Same
  selection-scoping as the original (selection range, or whole doc when
  empty) and same per-unit transform (analytic_unit→card, analytic→tag,
  heading id + body slots preserved).

- **AI table-from-image: large tables + a repair fallback** (`image-ai.ts`,
  `anthropic.ts`). Large tables were truncated by the 4096-token cap — the
  dominant cause, confirmed via `stop_reason === 'max_tokens'`. Fixes:
  - The table JSON schema (now shared between the extraction and repair
    prompts as `TABLE_SCHEMA_AND_RULES`) is COMPACT: cells emit only
    non-default fields, so a plain cell is `{ "text": "..." }` instead of
    carrying `bold/italic/colspan/rowspan` defaults. `validateTableSpec`
    already defaults missing fields, so no parse change was needed — this
    just cuts output size ~5×.
  - `maxTokens` raised 4096 → 16384.
  - `callAnthropic` now returns `stopReason` (the API `stop_reason`).
  - On validation failure: if `stopReason === 'max_tokens'` the data is
    genuinely cut off → a clear "too large" toast (no repair, since
    reformatting truncated JSON would silently drop rows). Otherwise (a
    real format error) a text-only repair call (`TABLE_REPAIR_SYSTEM_PROMPT`)
    reformats the broken output via the shared `parseTableSpec` helper.

- **Extract Undertag command.** New bindable command `extractUndertag`
  (`ribbon-commands.ts`, label "Extract Undertag", no default key, card
  dropdown → Excerpt section, Editing-utilities group). Walks up from the
  selection to the enclosing `card` (requires a non-empty selection and a
  card whose first child is a `tag`), reads the selection text
  (`textBetween` with block→space collapse), and inserts a new `undertag`
  node after the card's last existing undertag (or right after the tag).
  It's a copy — the original text is untouched — and the cursor lands at
  the end of the new undertag. A new `extractUndertagInQuotes` boolean
  setting (Editing category, off by default) wraps the excerpt in double
  quotes; it reaches the command via a new `RibbonContext` getter
  `extractUndertagInQuotes` → `settings.get('extractUndertagInQuotes')`.

- **Word-style paragraph navigation: cleaner collapse / cross-block
  targets** (`word-selection-keymap.ts`).
  - `verticalCommandPair`'s Down (`to-end`) move with a non-empty
    selection now collapses to the START of the paragraph after the
    selection-end paragraph (`nextTextblock(corner.end()).start`) instead
    of `corner.end()` — so a following Ctrl/Alt+Down continues downward
    rather than stopping at the current paragraph's end first. The
    `$to.parentOffset === 0` spill case (after Ctrl/Alt+Shift+Down)
    collapses to that paragraph's own start (it already IS the next
    paragraph); a selection ending in the last textblock parks at its end.
    Up (`from-start`) is unchanged (start of the selection's paragraph).
  - `destPrevUnit`'s cross-block case (Ctrl/Alt+Left at a paragraph start)
    now returns `prev.end` — the END of the previous textblock, after its
    trailing word/punctuation — instead of the start of that block's last
    unit. Mirrors the forward direction (`destNextUnit` → `next.start`):
    both stop just across the paragraph break.

- **Notes — a private, threaded annotation (fourth comments-bar kind).** A
  `Note` entity in `learn-store.ts` (`{ noteId, docId, comments:
  LocalComment[], anchor, createdAt }`), parallel to `AiThread`: stored in
  the LearnStore (never serialized into the doc → private), anchored by
  `AnchorDescriptor` + a green decoration (`'note'` kind in
  `learn-highlight-plugin.ts` → `.pmd-note-range`). Store methods
  (`addNote` / `getNote` / `appendNoteComment` / `editNoteComment` /
  `setNoteAnchor` / `removeNote` / `notesForDoc`) plus JSON (de)serialize
  and the doc-lifecycle hooks (`copyDocAnnotations` fork-copies with fresh
  ids, `rekeyDoc`, `forgetDoc`). The comments column (`comments-ui.ts`)
  gets a `NOTE_PREFIX`, a green `'note'` chip, and a full render path
  (merge/sort by doc position, `populateNote` reusing `renderAiComment`,
  `buildNoteInput` / `addNoteComment`, `activateNote`, `deleteNote`,
  unanchored row + `regroundNote`). Creation is a new ribbon command
  `addNoteToSelection` (`ribbon-commands.ts`, default `Mod-Shift-n`,
  Comments group) + a ribbon button (new `note` icon) wired in `index.ts`;
  `threadIdAtCursor` maps the `'note'` range kind to `NOTE_PREFIX`.

- **Inline edit for comments and notes.** A pencil edit button
  (`buildEditButton`) on every human-comment turn (`renderComment`) and
  note turn (`renderAiComment` gains an optional `onEdit`; AI threads omit
  it). Clicking swaps the body for a textarea + Save/Cancel via a shared
  `startInlineEdit`; human comments commit through the existing
  `editCommentTextMeta`, notes through a new `editNoteComment(noteId,
  index, text)`. New `edit` icon added to the `gen-icons.mjs` MAP
  (`edit-02`); the note button's icon also comes from the MAP (`file-02`).

- **Opt-in export of the private layer as comments.** Two new Save As
  Custom-Save checkboxes (off by default) on `SaveAsResult` —
  `includeNotes` / `includeAiThreads` (`save-as-ui.ts`). `serializeForSave`
  (`index.ts`) gains `bakePrivateThreadsIntoDoc`: for each opted-in
  note / AI thread it resolves the anchor against the export doc, mints a
  `comment_range` mark + a real `Thread` (user turns → `human`, AI turns →
  `ai`) via a temp `EditorState`, and hands the marked-up doc + threads to
  the serializer. Baking the private layer forces a derived (non-identity-
  adopting) save so the working doc keeps both its identity and its
  private notes (no double-load on reopen).

- **Performance: annotation creation no longer re-anchors the whole doc.**
  `resolveDescriptor` flattens the entire document; the comments column
  used to re-resolve EVERY flashcard / AI thread / note on EVERY
  `learnStore` change (creation did it twice; each reply did it again).
  Fixes:
  - `learn-anchor.ts` exposes `flattenDoc` + `resolveDescriptorIn(flat,
    d)` so a batch resolve flattens once, not per descriptor.
  - `learn-highlight-plugin.ts` gains `upsert` / `remove` range metas
    (`upsertFlashcardRangeTr` / `removeFlashcardRangeTr`) to set or drop a
    single range by id at a KNOWN position — no walk.
  - The store subscription now runs `reconcileAnchors` (incremental):
    resolves a descriptor only for an annotation that's newly anchored
    but absent from the plugin, prunes ranges for deleted ones, and
    short-circuits to a plain render otherwise. Note / AI creation and
    re-ground call `placeLocalAnnotation` to set the range from the live
    selection BEFORE the store mutation, so the reconcile finds it already
    present and never resolves. `activateNote` / `activateAiThread` render
    instead of re-resolving. Full resolution (`refreshFlashcardAnchors`,
    now also flatten-once) is reserved for doc load, column show, pane
    switch, and edit-driven range drops.

- **Save Send Doc command + shortcut.** A new bindable command
  `saveSendDoc` (`ribbon-commands.ts`, default `Mod-Alt-s`, File group,
  palette aliases "send doc" / "export send doc" / "send version") that
  automates the Save As dialog's Send Doc preset: it saves the document
  with comments, analytics, and undertags stripped (full, non-read-mode
  export — same `transformForExport` filter the preset uses) in one
  keystroke, with no dialog. Driven by `runSaveSendDocFlow` (`index.ts`),
  a lossy export that leaves the working doc's identity, dirty state, and
  journal untouched (only a recents entry is added), mirroring the
  preset's non-full-save branch.

  Destination and format come from settings rather than the dialog:
  - `sendDocDestination` (new `sendDocDestination` setting kind — radio
    editor in `settings-ui.ts`, electron-only) chooses between
    `sameFolder` (write beside the source file) and `fixedFolder`.
  - `sendDocFolder` (reuses the existing `folder` setting kind, with the
    `pickDirectory` browse/clear UI) is the fixed-folder target.
  - Format follows `defaultSaveFormat`; the `SEND_` filename prefix
    honors `prefixPresetSaveFilenames`, exactly like the preset.

  The silent write goes through a new Electron host method
  `ElectronHost.saveSendDoc` → IPC `host:save-send-doc` (`main.ts`):
  the renderer resolves the destination (`folder`, or the source's
  `siblingHandle`) plus the final filename, and main joins, `mkdir -p`s,
  and writes. Main returns the literal `'collision'` when the resolved
  target would overwrite the source document (prefix off + same folder +
  same format) so the renderer can fall back to the dialog instead of
  clobbering it. The flow also falls back to `getHost().saveAs` for a
  never-saved doc in same-folder mode, an unset fixed folder, or a
  non-Electron host — so the command always does *something* sensible.

- **Select all instances of a style (right-click a ribbon style button).**
  A `contextmenu` handler on each structural / character style button
  (`index.ts`, `FORMATTING_PANEL_SELECT_ALL`) lights up every instance of
  that style as a shadow selection, reusing the Select Similar Formatting
  machinery so the result is `getOperatingRanges`-visible and the
  existing format commands act across all instances at once. New plugin
  exports in `similar-selection-plugin.ts`:
  - `StyleSelector` — `{ kind: 'block'; nodeType }` (matches a textblock
    type's content runs) or `{ kind: 'mark'; markTypes }` (matches text
    runs carrying any of the marks, contiguous runs merged).
  - `computeStyleMatches(doc, selector, scope?)` — pure matcher, scope-
    clamped.
  - `selectAllOfStyle(selector)` — the command. Scope is **sticky**: a
    fresh non-empty PM selection sets/replaces the scope (bounded match +
    scope tint, via a new `setMatchesScoped` plugin meta that sets
    matches + scope in one idle-mode step); with no fresh selection an
    existing scope is reused, so repeated right-clicks and the format
    operations chained between them stay bounded to the same region
    (format ops already preserve the shadow via `META_OPERATING_ON_SHADOW`
    and the scope rides along in the same plugin state). It collapses a
    live selection so the shadow, not the browser selection, drives bulk
    ops, and returns false (no dispatch) when nothing matches so the
    caller can toast without disturbing the existing shadow.

  The Underline selector deliberately matches only `underline_mark` (the
  named body style), not `underline_direct` — by the schema's body-vs-
  structural invariant the latter is the raw underline used inside tags /
  analytics / other structural blocks, which aren't instances of the
  underline *style*.

- **Cursor-on-style indicator on the ribbon style buttons.** A new
  `refreshFormattingPanelButtonStates()` (`index.ts`) sets `aria-pressed`
  on each formatting-panel button to reflect the cursor's current style,
  wired into `dispatchTransaction` next to the existing font-size / color
  refreshers (plus the view-chrome re-sync and mount paths). Structural
  buttons match the cursor's enclosing textblock type
  (`$from.parent.type.name`); character buttons match its marks via a
  standard `markActive` helper (`isMarkActiveInSelection`). Two guards
  worth noting: it skips the refresh when `$from.parent` isn't a
  textblock — a gap cursor between blocks (or a node selection) otherwise
  blanks every button even though the visible caret hasn't moved into new
  text, so the indicator holds the last real run's style; and Underline
  matches only `underline_mark`, not `underline_direct` (same body-vs-
  structural reasoning as select-all — direct underline in tags /
  analytics isn't the underline style). One CSS rule reuses the standard
  toggle wash: `#ribbon .formatting-panel-btn[aria-pressed="true"]` →
  `--pmd-c-button-active`.

- **Select Similar / select-all decorations reuse the Find palette.** The
  scope band (`.pmd-similar-scope`) now uses the same faint-blue
  within-selection tint as `.pmd-find-scope` (`--pmd-c-drop-*`), and each
  match (`.pmd-similar-match`) uses Find's current-match orange band +
  outline (`--pmd-c-find-match-current*`, kept dashed to read as a shadow
  selection). Previously both were near-identical ambers that blurred
  together. The now-dead `--pmd-c-similar-{scope,match}-*` variables were
  removed from both themes (`--pmd-c-similar-deep-text` stays — still used
  by the manage-cards list).

- **Documentation streamlined** (`README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `PROJECT.md`, `src/editor/index.ts`). The prior docs were
  agent-generated — long, repetitive, padded with implementation
  narration, and in places inaccurate about what shipped. Rewritten
  against the voice of Verbatim's own published manual (plain, direct,
  task-first): ARCHITECTURE 1651 → ~640 lines (kept the schema,
  round-trip contract, rendering model, and editing-boundary rules; cut
  the changelog-style ribbon catalog and play-by-play; corrected
  overstated status — transclusion, corpus-search indexing, the cleanup
  ribbon family, and collaboration moved to a clearly-marked roadmap, and
  Electron noted as settled). PROJECT reduced to a one-screen orientation
  + accurate shipped/planned/out-of-scope snapshot. README intro and
  updates sections tightened (verbose install steps and acknowledgements
  kept). The in-editor welcome doc (`makeStarterDoc`) trimmed to the same
  voice with every interactive structure demo preserved, plus a new
  "Study your evidence" section for flashcards. ARCHITECTURE §17 gained a
  "Why this design (the evidence)" subsection grounding the
  spaced-repetition choices in the mnemonic-medium research (Quantum
  Country, Orbit, Augmenting Long-term Memory, Matuschak's notes), cited
  by public URL; the dead pointer to the gitignored learn-system spec was
  dropped. CHANGELOG/DETAILED_CHANGELOG untouched except for this note.

## 0.1.0-alpha.8 — 2026-06-01

- **"Show in context" from a flashcard review.** A third action in the
  review session (`learn-session-ui.ts`, button + key `3`, shown only
  when the card has an anchor whose doc has a known path —
  `pickCardSource`, unit-tested) opens the card's source focused on its
  anchored text, without grading the card. The session UI stays
  store-only and reaches the app through a host hook in
  `learn-store-host.ts` (`setShowInContextHandler` /
  `showFlashcardInContext`, passed the session's `cleanup` so the handler
  decides whether to close the review). `index.ts` registers
  `showFlashcardSource`, which routes by context, reusing a shared
  `focusDescriptorInActiveView` (resolveDescriptor → select +
  `preciseScrollIntoView`):
  - **Multi-pane:** delegates to `MultiPaneShell.showInContext` (new
    `enableMultiDocMode` hook) — focuses the slot already holding the doc
    and scrolls, or loads it into the first empty slot (slot 1 if all
    three are occupied; no picker) and scrolls on mount; closes the
    review + home (they cover the whole workspace).
  - **Single-doc, source is the current doc:** closes the review *and the
    home screen* (both overlay the doc) and focuses in place.
  - **Single-doc, open in another window:** new cross-window IPC
    (`host:focus-anchor-in-window` → main focuses the owner window and
    sends it `host:focus-anchor`; every window registers an
    `onFocusAnchor` receiver that scrolls its doc). Review stays up.
  - **Single-doc, not open:** spawns a new window carrying a
    `focusAnchor` on the spawn payload (`SpawnWindowPayload` /
    `InitialDocPayload`), which `mountFromSpawnPayload` focuses on mount.
    Review stays up.
  - **Web / no spawn host:** opens in place + focuses; closes review.
  New host-bridge surface: `focusAnchorInWindow` / `onFocusAnchor` on the
  preload, `ElectronAPI` interface, and `ElectronHost` class (guarded so
  an older preload degrades gracefully).

- **Cursor focus for AI-comment / flashcard cards (consistent with
  comments).** Clicking commented text focuses its thread because
  `threadIdAtCursor` (`index.ts`) reads the `comment_range` mark at the
  cursor and the existing `dispatchTransaction` wiring hands the id to
  `commentsColumn.setActiveThread`. AI threads and flashcards are
  local-only (`learnStore` + an `AnchorDescriptor`) and anchor via
  `learnHighlightPlugin` decorations, not a mark — so they never
  serialize, but a mark lookup missed them and `setActiveThread(null)`
  actually cleared any active card. Fix: new pure
  `flashcardRangeAt(state, pos)` in `learn-highlight-plugin.ts` returns
  the resolved highlight range containing a position (both ends
  inclusive, first match wins); `threadIdAtCursor` falls back to it when
  no comment mark is found and returns the column's prefixed id
  (`AI_PREFIX`/`FC_PREFIX`, now exported from `comments-ui.ts`) by
  `range.kind`. Comment marks still win when text carries both.
  Everything downstream (`setActiveThread`, card expand/scroll, in-doc
  active-range emphasis) already keys on the prefixed id, so AI and
  flashcard cards now focus on cursor exactly like comments and collapse
  when the cursor leaves.

- **Optional live selection word count (`liveSelectionWordCount`, default
  off).** The status-bar read-time counter (`refreshWordCount` in
  `index.ts`) only re-ran inside the debounced, `tx.docChanged`-gated
  `scheduleHeavyUpdate`, so selecting text without editing never updated
  the readout — and the `Selection: …` branch only ever showed on the
  next edit, against whatever selection happened to exist then. Rather
  than make every selection change pay an O(doc) recount (a cursor move
  with no selection recomputes the whole doc), this is now an opt-in
  setting:
  - When on, `dispatchTransaction` has a selection-only branch that
    calls `refreshWordCount({ selectionOnly: true })` — gated on the
    selection actually changing and a range being involved on either
    side, so plain cursor moves (empty → empty) do nothing. A non-empty
    selection counts only its range (`countReadAloudWords(doc, from,
    to)`); a collapse reuses a cached whole-doc count
    (`lastWholeDocWords`) instead of re-walking. The cache is nulled on
    any doc change so a collapse before the debounced recount can't show
    a stale total.
  - When off (default), `refreshWordCount` ignores the selection
    entirely and always shows the whole-doc count, and the
    selection-only branch is skipped — no per-selection work, and no
    stale `Selection: …`. A selection's read time stays available via
    the Word Count button (Σ / Word Count Selection dialog).
  Added the boolean to the `Settings` interface, defaults (false),
  sanitizer, and `SETTING_METADATA` (General, toggle); the existing
  settings subscription re-renders the bar when the toggle flips.

## 0.1.0-alpha.7 — 2026-05-30

- **"Delete Current Heading" bindable command (`deleteCurrentHeading`).**
  Sibling to `selectCurrentHeading` / `copyCurrentHeading` — same
  cursor-only enclosing-structure bounds (`enclosingStructureRange` via
  the shared `speech-doc-send.ts` helpers), but it removes the structure
  instead of selecting it. Importantly it deletes the whole node range
  (`tr.delete(from, to)`) rather than emulating select-then-Delete: a
  text-selection delete over an `isolating` card empties the card but
  keeps its now-blank shell, which this command must not do. New pure,
  testable `buildDeleteStructureTr(state)` returns the delete transaction
  (or null when the cursor isn't in a deletable structure) and re-homes
  the cursor to the nearest valid spot; `deleteCurrentHeadingIn(view)` in
  `index.ts` dispatches it via the same `view`-is-the-focused-pane ctx
  hook the select/copy commands use (works single-doc + multi-pane).
  Registered through the standard path (id union, IDs, label, alias
  "delete card"/"delete heading", unbound default key, View ribbon
  group, `commandFor` case, `RibbonContext` hook).

- **Windows "New → CardMirror Document" context-menu entry (drafted,
  UNVERIFIED on Windows).** Scaffolding for a right-click "New" submenu
  item via the classic ShellNew registry mechanism — no shell-extension
  DLL, just a registry value + a template file. `scripts/gen-new-template.ts`
  (run via `npm run gen:new-template`) serializes a minimal blank doc (a
  single empty paragraph) to `apps/desktop/resources/new-template.cmir`
  through the real `serializeNative`, so it's always a valid current-
  format `.cmir`; the file is committed and shipped via electron-builder
  `extraResources` to `$INSTDIR\resources\new-template.cmir`.
  `apps/desktop/build/installer.nsh` (auto-included by electron-builder)
  writes `SHCTX\Software\Classes\.cmir\ShellNew\FileName` to that path on
  install and removes it on uninstall; SHCTX follows the per-user /
  per-machine install scope, matching where the existing `.cmir`
  `fileAssociations` registration lives (which also supplies the menu
  label "CardMirror Document"). Not yet tested on a real Windows machine
  — left as a ready-to-verify draft; kept out of the user-facing
  changelog until confirmed working.

- **In-file object search matches a tag by its card's cite.** Diving
  into a file (`extractFile` in `file-search.ts`) produced a `tag`
  `FileObject` whose only searchable text was the tag's own words, and
  `searchFileObjects` matched on `label` alone — so an author/date never
  surfaced its tag (unlike Ctrl-F, which can match the card via the
  `cite_paragraph`). `FileObject` gains an optional `cite` field;
  `extractFile` now always collects cite text (`collectHeadings` without
  `skipCite`, so it's available even when the standalone `cite` object
  *kind* is off — that flag still only gates the separate CITE rows) and
  attaches the card's cite to its tag object. `searchFileObjects` matches
  against `label + cite` for tags (label leads, so a label hit still
  outranks a cite-only hit). `fileObjectResult` shows the cite as the
  row's secondary text for tags, so a cite-match reads clearly and tags
  carry their citation like the nav pane. Since a tag is now findable by
  its cite, the standalone `cite` object kind is redundant and now
  defaults OFF (`fileSearchObjectTypes` default + sanitize fallback +
  `DEFAULT_FILE_OBJECT_KINDS` all drop `'cite'`); it stays a configurable
  toggle for anyone who wants separate CITE rows.

- **OS "Open with…" routes into the workspace in multi-pane mode.**
  `openExternalFile` (main) always did `createWindow({ initialDoc })`,
  but the renderer's multi-pane boot never read `getInitialDoc()` (only
  single-doc boot did), so an externally-opened `.docx`/`.cmir` produced
  a blank workspace window. Fix has two halves:
  - Main keeps a `multiPaneWindows` set, populated/cleared by a new
    `host:register-multipane` IPC the renderer calls at boot (true in
    multi-pane boot, false in single-pane boot — so it survives the
    reload a workspace-mode toggle triggers, and is cleared on window
    `closed`). `openExternalFile` now `pickMultiPaneTarget()`s a
    multi-pane window (focused first, else any) and forwards the path
    via `host:external-open` (focusing/restoring it) instead of
    spawning; with no multi-pane window it falls back to the existing
    read-and-`createWindow` path — so single-pane is byte-for-byte
    unchanged, and cold launch still spawns.
  - The renderer (multi-pane boot) registers, subscribes to
    `host:external-open` (→ `openFileByPath` → `routeOpenedFile` → slot
    picker), and runs `routeInitialDocIntoWorkspace()` — reading any
    spawn payload and routing it through `routeOpenedFile` (slot picker)
    rather than booting blank; recovery is skipped when a payload was
    consumed, mirroring single-doc. New bridge methods
    `registerMultipane` / `onExternalOpen` on the preload, `ElectronAPI`
    interface, and `ElectronHost` class (guarded for older preloads).
  - Net behavior (the user's choice): a workspace window already open —
    populated or empty — is reused and shows the slot picker (no new
    window); only when no workspace window exists does it open one and
    show the picker there. Single-pane keeps spawning a window per file.

- **Command-bar file search refreshes the open palette live.** The
  background `.cmir` revalidation in main (`revalidateCmirIndex`,
  `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`) updated its cache but never told the
  renderer, so the comment's "picked up on the next palette open" was
  literally the only way to see fresh results. Now, when the re-scan
  finds the listing changed, main `broadcastCmirIndexUpdated(root,
  entries)` to every window via `host:cmir-files-updated`. The preload
  exposes `onCmirFileIndexUpdated(handler)` (mirroring
  `onDropzoneChanged`), surfaced on the `ElectronAPI` interface +
  `ElectronHost` class (guarded so an older preload degrades to no live
  refresh). `QuickCardSearchUI` subscribes on open / unsubscribes on
  close and handles the event in `onFileIndexUpdated`, designed so an
  in-progress search is never disrupted:
  - filters by `root` (ignores broadcasts for a different search
    folder) and bails if the palette is closed;
  - swaps `this.fileList` to the fresh listing and re-warms pins against
    the new mtimes, but does NOT bump `asyncToken` — so it can't abort
    an in-flight `enterInFile` read (and there's no `loadFileList` race:
    main returns the cached listing before starting the walk that emits
    the event, so the load always resolves first);
  - if the user has Tab'd into a file (`inFile`), leaves the visible
    object results untouched — the fresh listing is just staged for when
    they Esc back;
  - otherwise re-runs the current query (the input text is the source of
    truth, untouched) only when files are actually on screen (prefix `f`
    or a non-empty everything search), and restores the selection by
    identity (`resultKey`) so the cursor doesn't bounce to the top.

- **Edge autoscroll while selecting text.** Dragging a text selection to
  the top/bottom of the viewport now scrolls the document so the
  selection can extend past the originally visible area. Built into
  `word-selection-plugin.ts`, which already owns all mouse text
  selection (it `preventDefault`s the native drag and drives the
  selection via dispatched transactions in `installDragListeners`). The
  drag listeners now also: resolve the nearest scrollable ancestor of
  `view.dom` (`#app` single-doc, `.pmd-pane-body` per pane), track the
  pointer, and run a `requestAnimationFrame` loop while the pointer sits
  in a top/bottom edge band. Each frame scrolls the viewport by
  `edgeAutoscrollDelta(top, bottom, clientY)` (ramped 1px→20px with
  depth into the band, exported + unit-tested) and re-extends the
  selection to `posAtCoords` of the pointer — clamped just inside the
  scroller so a pointer parked past the edge keeps pulling in the
  edge-most line even while held still. The loop self-reschedules only
  while it actually scrolls, so it stops at the scroll limit or when the
  pointer leaves the band; it tears down on mouseup. Works in both
  single-doc and multi-pane because it's keyed off each view's own
  scroller, and needs no new wiring since the plugin is already in
  `buildEditorPlugins`.

- **`findRememberLastQuery` is honored again.** The find bar
  (`find-replace-ui.ts`) reuses one DOM input across open/close and
  never cleared it, so once a query was typed it lingered in the
  element. `open()` only pre-filled "when the input is empty", which was
  never true after the first use — so the remembered query stayed
  visible regardless of the setting (and `close()`'s gated persist was
  irrelevant). Fix: capture `wasClosed = this.root.hidden` before
  un-hiding, and on a fresh open set the input value deterministically —
  `settings.get('findLastQuery')` when `findRememberLastQuery` is on,
  `''` when off — instead of conditionally pre-filling only an
  already-empty field. Guarding on `wasClosed` means re-triggering while
  the bar is open (Ctrl-F → Ctrl-H mode switch) still preserves what's
  typed.

- **"Cycle Theme" ribbon command (`cycleTheme`).** A bindable command
  that rotates the `theme` setting light → dark → system → light. Added
  through the standard registry path: the `RibbonCommandId` union,
  `RIBBON_COMMAND_IDS`, `RIBBON_COMMAND_LABELS` ("Cycle Theme (Light →
  Dark → System)"), `RIBBON_COMMAND_ALIASES` (dark mode / light mode /
  toggle theme / switch theme), `DEFAULT_RIBBON_KEYS` (`''` — unbound),
  the `View` ribbon group (satisfies the drift guard), and a
  `commandFor` case that calls a new `RibbonContext.cycleTheme` hook.
  The hook is implemented in `index.ts` where the context is built: it
  reads `settings.get('theme')`, advances through `['light','dark',
  'system']`, calls `settings.set('theme', next)` (the existing
  subscription re-runs `applyTheme`), and shows a `Theme: <next>` toast.
  Being in the registry, it auto-appears in the keybindings editor, the
  shortcuts reference, and the command palette — no per-surface wiring.

- **Analytic / Undertag document colors: unified the two settings,
  fixed the inert Appearance picker, and made dark-mode behavior
  correct.** Two settings both targeted the same CSS vars and fought.
  `applyDisplayColors` (Appearance → "Style colors", `displayColors`)
  wrote `--pmd-color-analytic` / `--pmd-color-undertag` inline on
  `:root`; `applyCustomColorOverrides` (Accessibility → "Color
  overrides", `customColorOverrides`, whose `CUSTOMIZABLE_COLOR_TOKENS`
  includes those two) ran *last* and, for any token not in the
  overrides blob, called `removeProperty('--pmd-color-analytic')` —
  wiping the displayColors write. Net effect: the Appearance picker did
  nothing unless you also set an Accessibility override.

  Reworked onto a single source of truth (`displayColors`) with a
  CSS-variable indirection so the theme can layer on top:
  - `applyDisplayColors` now writes the user's pick to
    `--pmd-user-color-*` (not `--pmd-color-*`). `style.css` resolves
    the effective `--pmd-color-*` from it: `:root` →
    `var(--pmd-user-color-analytic, #1F3864)` (light = user color);
    `:root[data-theme="dark"]` → the built-in `#8aa9d1` / `#8fb377`
    (chrome/nav, readable on dark — now actually effective because the
    inline write targets a *different* variable);
    `:root[data-theme="dark"]:not([data-theme-doc="dark"]) :is(#editor,
    .pmd-pane-editor)` → back to `var(--pmd-user-color-*, …)` so the
    document keeps the user color while it's on paper; with apply-to-doc
    ON the editor inherits the dark `#8aa9d1` instead. Behavior matrix:
    light = user / user; dark not-applied = light-blue nav / user doc;
    dark applied = light-blue / light-blue.
  - `applyCustomColorOverrides` is now passed `CUSTOM_OVERRIDE_TOKEN_NAMES`
    (the manifest minus the two document-text tokens) so it can no
    longer remove/clobber them.
  - The Accessibility "Document text" rows (`buildColorOverridesEditor`)
    are special-cased via `DISPLAY_COLOR_TOKEN_TO_KEY`: they read/write
    `displayColors`, hide the alpha slider, and reset to
    `DEFAULT_DISPLAY_COLORS` — so they're a linked view of the same
    value the Appearance picker edits.
  - `buildColorsEditor` (Appearance) gains a per-row reset-to-default
    button; "Reset all overrides" also resets `displayColors`.
  - Migration: `sanitizeDisplayColors(raw, rawOverrides)` folds any
    legacy `customColorOverrides['pmd-color-analytic'|'pmd-color-undertag']`
    into `displayColors` (the override wins — it's what actually
    rendered), and `sanitizeCustomColorOverrides` drops those two tokens
    so there's no double source going forward.

- **Command-palette search aliases for settings and commands.** The
  Search-Everything palette matched a query only against a command's
  `RIBBON_COMMAND_LABELS` entry or a setting's `SettingMeta.label`, so
  anything phrased differently than the label simply didn't appear.
  Two new alias registries fix that, matched but never displayed:
  `RIBBON_COMMAND_ALIASES` (a `Partial<Record<RibbonCommandId,
  readonly string[]>>` in `ribbon-commands.ts`) and an optional
  `aliases?: readonly string[]` on `SettingMeta` (`settings.ts`).
  `searchCommandSource` / `searchSettingsSource` in
  `quick-card-search-ui.ts` now build the match haystack from
  `label + ' ' + aliases.join(' ')` while still ranking by first-token
  position *within the label* (an alias-only hit ranks via `Infinity`,
  so label hits always sort ahead). Two recurring motivations: the
  show/hide ⇄ toggle bridge the user asked for (`toggleCommentsVisible`
  ⇄ "toggle comments", `toggleNavPane` ⇄ "toggle navigation pane" /
  "sidebar"), and vague or Word-flavored labels ("Clear" ⇄ "clear
  formatting", "Paste Plain Text" ⇄ "paste without formatting"). The
  Theme setting gains `light mode` / `dark mode` / `toggle theme` /
  `system theme` / `color scheme`; other settings get the obvious
  alternate names (Line spacing ⇄ "line height", Interface font ⇄ "ui
  font", Reduce motion ⇄ "animations", Three-pane workspace ⇄ "split
  view", etc.). Aliases are lowercase because the palette lowercases
  the query before matching.

- **Learn section keeps Manage reachable with zero flashcards.**
  `renderLearn` in `src/editor/home-screen.ts` used to replace the
  whole section with a single muted placeholder card when
  `totalCount({ kind: 'all' }) === 0`. But "Manage flashcards" opens
  the manage UI, which carries the Import button — the only way to
  bring in cards from a file — so the empty state was a dead end for
  anyone trying to import. The empty branch now renders the same
  two-card row as the populated state: a disabled "Review all" card
  (new `{ disabled }` option on `actionCard` — sets `btn.disabled`,
  adds `.pmd-home-action-disabled`, skips the click listener) and a
  live "Manage flashcards" card. The keyboard-shortcut runner for
  Manage lost its `totalCount > 0` guard for the same reason. The
  orphaned `.pmd-home-action-placeholder` CSS was repurposed into
  `.pmd-home-action-disabled` (muted opacity, neutral hover).

## 0.1.0-alpha.6 — 2026-05-30

- **`.cmir` loader stamps fresh ids on id-less headings at parse
  time.** New `stampMissingHeadingIds(doc)` in `src/schema/ids.ts`
  walks the parsed `PMNode` tree and reconstructs any pocket /
  hat / block / tag / analytic whose `id` attr is null with a
  fresh UUID. `parseNative` calls it on the
  `schema.nodeFromJSON(file.doc)` output. Origin of the id-less
  headings: PM's schema fitter, when it bubbled up F2's
  multi-line plain-paste split to the card level, synthesized
  the second-half card's mandatory first-child tag from the
  schema's `headingAttrs.id.default` (= `null`) rather than via
  `newHeadingId()`. That path is closed at the source as of the
  F2 fix earlier in this release, but old docs written before
  the fix carry those id-less tags frozen into the file.
  `setCaretHeading` in `nav-panel.ts` keys the cursor → nav
  highlight on the heading id (skipping null), so an id-less tag
  is functionally invisible to the highlight — the cursor in
  that card appears in the *previous* card's slot. Stamping at
  load repairs the file in place; the next save (in any path
  that writes the doc back through `serializeNative`) makes the
  repair persistent. The walk runs once at parse time, returns
  the original node by identity when nothing needed stamping
  (no-op cost), and preserves indent / spacing / other attrs
  on the stamped heading. A pair of tests in
  `tests/native/native.test.ts` covers the load-time stamp and
  the existing-id no-op; a focused suite in
  `tests/schema/stamp-missing-heading-ids.test.ts` covers the
  helper across the full heading set + edge cases (round-trip
  identity when nothing's null, isolated stamping in mixed docs,
  attr preservation).

- **Fast Debate Paste integration — main-process HTTP bridge +
  renderer-side insertion primitive.** Spec lives at
  `reference-docs/cardmirror-integration-spec.md`. New
  `apps/desktop/src/fast-paste-bridge.ts` boots a Node `http`
  server on `127.0.0.1:17699` (ephemeral fallback on EADDRINUSE)
  in `app.whenReady()`. On start it generates a fresh per-launch
  token via `crypto.randomBytes(24)`, writes the discovery file
  at `app.getPath('userData')/fast-paste-bridge.json` via
  tmp-then-rename, and tears both down on `before-quit`. Both
  routes constant-time-compare `X-FDP-Token`; mismatched / absent
  token → 403. Any request carrying `Origin` or `Referer` is
  also rejected (the DNS-rebinding-from-a-browser-page guard the
  spec calls out). `GET /ping` replies with
  `{ok, app, appVersion, schema, hasActiveDoc}`. `POST /insert`
  forwards `{requestId, text, role, newParagraph, omitted}` to
  the focused window's renderer via `external:insert-text` IPC
  and awaits the renderer's `external:insert-result` reply with
  a hard 1200ms timeout so the client never hangs (it enforces
  1500ms on its end before falling back to keystrokes). Error
  codes map: `no-target-doc` / `doc-readonly` → 200 with
  `ok:false`, `bad-request` → 400, `unauthorized` → 403,
  anything else → 500. Unknown `role` values degrade to `card`.

  Renderer side: new preload channels (`external:insert-text`
  receive, `external:insert-result` send) on the existing
  contextBridge surface — no `executeJavaScript` under
  contextIsolation. `src/editor/external-insert-host.ts`
  subscribes via `installExternalInsertHost`, called from the
  boot block in `index.ts` alongside the dropzone controller.
  When a request arrives it resolves the live `EditorView` (or
  returns `no-target-doc` if none), checks `view.editable` for
  the read-mode gate (returns `doc-readonly` when the flag is
  off — the same gate that swallows F2 keystrokes today), and
  hands `{text, newParagraph}` to
  `src/editor/external-insert.ts`'s
  `buildExternalInsertTransaction`. The primitive splits `text`
  on `/\r\n|\r|\n/`, builds each piece as a `card_body` node
  (or `paragraph` when the cursor has no `card` / `analytic_unit`
  ancestor — i.e. at doc level), assembles a closed-start /
  open-end Slice, and `tr.replaceSelection`. The closed start
  makes the first inserted body a fresh sibling at the cursor
  (mirrors the keystroke bridge's "press Return first"); the
  open end merges the last body's content with whatever was
  after the cursor in the original textblock (mirrors what F2
  paste does after the Return). Because the node types are
  chosen directly, the schema's content expression is satisfied
  in one pass — no contextual fitting, no fitter bubble-up, no
  way for a pasted line to be elevated to a tag (which is the
  same failure mode the F2 fix in this release closes from the
  other direction).

  Tests cover the route layer (`tests/desktop/fast-paste-bridge.test.ts`,
  16 cases — token, ping shape, Origin/Referer rejection, all
  five error codes, payload validation, unknown-role degradation,
  no-focused-window short-circuit, discovery-file lifecycle),
  the primitive (`tests/editor/external-insert.test.ts`, 10
  cases — mid/start/end of card_body, multi-line, the spec's
  §9 acceptance case, doc-level fallback to `paragraph`, empty
  text, trailing newline, inline + leading-space convention),
  and the renderer-side host (`tests/editor/external-insert-host.test.ts`,
  7 cases — happy path with docTitle, inline, no-target-doc,
  doc-readonly, bad-request, docTitle suppression when no
  filename). Vitest's `electron` module is aliased to
  `tests/desktop/_electron-stub.ts` (electron isn't installed at
  the project root) so the bridge can be driven without
  bootstrapping a real Electron process.

- **F2 plain-paste: route through `tryPasteAsCardBodies` like rich
  paste does.** `applyPlainPasteFromText` (the Electron F2 entry
  point) and the armed-paste branch of `handlePaste` (the browser
  F2 entry point) both used to do `tr.replaceSelection(slice)`
  directly with the slice that `buildPlainTextSlice` produces — a
  `Fragment([paragraph(line1), paragraph(line2), …])` with
  `openStart=1 / openEnd=1`. `paragraph` is not in the `card`
  content expression (`tag (card_body | undertag | cite_paragraph
  | analytic | table)*`), so when the slice landed inside a
  `card_body` PM's Fitter could only fit the first and last
  paragraphs via the openings — every middle paragraph then bubbled
  the split up to the card level. The Fitter's second-half
  reconstruction has to start with a `tag` (the card's content rule
  is non-negotiable), so it would either synthesize a phantom
  empty-tag card sibling or, in the configurations the FDP spec
  flagged, convert the first content node it had on hand into a
  tag — which is where the "extra spacing between pasted lines"
  user reports come from (the tag's `margin: 0.75rem 0 0.25rem 0`
  rendering as the gap). The absorb plugin re-claims orphan
  paragraphs into the preceding card, but the brief bubble-up plus
  re-absorption still moves the cursor through an awkward
  trajectory before landing it. The fix is the same one
  `handlePaste` already uses on the rich-paste path
  (`paste-plugin.ts:269-272`): call `tryPasteAsCardBodies` first to
  pre-convert the slice's `paragraph` nodes to `card_body` nodes
  before `tr.replace`, so the Fitter has no fitting problem to
  solve. The cursor now lands at the end of the last pasted line
  (or on the trailing empty body when the text ends in a newline,
  which is the "cursor on a fresh line is fine" case). Slices where
  `tryPasteAsCardBodies` returns null (single-line paste, non-
  card-body cursor, non-paragraph children) keep going through
  `replaceSelection` as before.

- **F12 dissolve + absorb-plugin: cursor preservation for the
  inside-the-replaced-range case.** Two related fixes in one entry.

  (1) `applyClearToNormalDemote` in `ribbon-commands.ts` dissolves a
  card or analytic_unit when F12 lands on its head (tag / analytic):
  it builds a `paragraph(cleanedHeadContent)` plus a lifted version
  of each trailing child (`card_body` / `cite_paragraph` →
  `paragraph`, `undertag` kept, `analytic` → `analytic_unit`-wrapped),
  then `tr.replaceWith(containerStart, containerEnd, lifted)`. PM's
  default `ReplaceStep` selection mapping pushes any position inside
  the replaced range to the END of the replacement (the assoc=1
  right-association convention) — same root cause as the original
  absorb-plugin "viewport rockets to doc end" bug. After the replace
  we now compute the cursor's logical position in the new structure
  via a new `mapPosThroughDissolve` helper (which walks the original
  container's children to find which one held the cursor + the
  intra-child offset, then resolves the corresponding position in
  the lifted-children sequence, accounting for the extra opening
  boundary that the analytic → analytic_unit wrap adds) and call
  `tr.setSelection(TextSelection.between(...))`. Same template as
  `dissolveContainerToHeading` at `ribbon-commands.ts:625-631`,
  which had this fix from the start.

  (2) `absorb-plugin.ts`'s surgical insert+delete preserved cursor
  positions outside the absorbed-orphan range but lost the ones
  inside it: step 2's `tr.delete(orphansStart+insertSize,
  orphansEnd+insertSize)` claims the cursor's range, and PM's
  default assoc=1 mapping pushes the cursor to the end of the
  deletion (which auto-snaps to the last textblock of the now-
  absorbed card). The plugin now captures `newState.selection`'s
  head/anchor before its steps run, flags whether either fell into
  any region's orphan range, and after the steps calls
  `tr.setSelection` with each flagged endpoint mapped to
  `origPos - 1` — the absorbed orphan now lives just before the
  card's closing boundary (one fewer doc-level boundary stands
  between the original orphan position and the new card_body
  position), so the position offset is `-1` regardless of how many
  orphans the region absorbs or how many regions absorb to the
  left.

  Together these handle the F12 → absorb cascade the user hit:
  F12 on Card B's tag (with Card A preceding it) demotes the tag
  to a paragraph at doc level, absorb claims that paragraph plus
  the lifted bodies into Card A, and the cursor follows the
  demoted text into Card A at the original character offset
  instead of landing at the tail of Card A's content. The probe
  test at `tests/editor/paste-viewport-bug.test.ts` (already a
  catalogue of this family of bugs) grows new F12 cases plus
  improved expectations on the pre-existing `H` scenario (cursor
  in an orphan paragraph that absorb claims).

- **Dropzone pill fallback now clears the status bar.** `.pmd-dropzone-
  root`'s CSS fallback `bottom` is now `calc(var(--status-bar-height)
  + 0.5rem)` (was `0.5rem`), and its `z-index` is `220` (was `12`,
  above the status bar's `200`). `positionDropzone` (`index.ts`) still
  reads `#app`'s / the focused pane body's live rect and inlines the
  exact `bottom`, but on some Windows machines that pass landed when
  the target's `getBoundingClientRect()` was 0×0 — the function
  early-returns there, and nothing later was firing to re-run it
  (`ResizeObserver` only fires on size *changes*; the layout-stabilizes-
  to-its-final-size case doesn't trigger a delta). The pill stayed at
  its CSS fallback, ~8px above the viewport bottom, sitting in the
  status bar's vertical band. A second symptom in the same screenshot
  (the pill rendering visibly on top of the status bar rather than
  being clipped by it despite `z-index: 12` losing to the bar's `200`)
  is consistent with a Chromium layer-promotion quirk on Windows,
  rooted in two body-level `position: fixed` elements with `box-
  shadow` ending up on independent composited layers whose paint
  order doesn't always honor the in-spec stacking. The new fallback
  prevents the overlap from happening in the first place; the z-index
  bump keeps the pill visible and clickable if a future layout change
  recreates an overlap.

- **Paste-time unwrap of single-cell layout tables.** `paste-plugin.ts`'s
  `transformPasted` hook now runs a new `unwrapSingleCellTables` pass
  ahead of `freshHeadingIds`. Pasting from sources that use `<table>`
  as a layout primitive (Google Docs published views, news-site article
  bodies, marketing emails, .docx page-frame copies) used to leave the
  wrapping `table` node intact in the parsed clipboard slice — and
  because both `table` and `table_cell` are `isolating: true` in our
  schema (`src/schema/nodes.ts:528, 573`), the surrounding `card_body`
  could neither join across the boundary nor be deleted around it.
  Visible failure modes: (a) an empty 1×1 table between a card's cite
  and its first body paragraph rendered as an apparently-empty line
  that Backspace would refuse to remove, expanding to swallow the
  whole card on retry; (b) a 1×1 with content rendered text inset
  from a real card body, with a small extra vertical gap above,
  because of the cell's default padding + the table's block-level
  margin. New rule: any `table` whose every row contains exactly one
  cell unwraps to the concatenation of its cells' paragraphs. Multi-
  cell-per-row tables (real data tables) pass through unchanged.
  Empty 1×1 tables fall out as the degenerate case (no paragraphs to
  lift). At the slice root we emit generic `paragraph` nodes so PM's
  contextual fitting and our own `tryPasteAsCardBodies` adapt them to
  the cursor's body slot; when the unwrap happens inside a `card` /
  `analytic_unit` already present in the slice (whole-card paste case),
  we emit `card_body` directly so the parent's content rule is
  satisfied without depending on downstream fitting. F2 plain-paste
  is unaffected because that path bypasses the HTML parser and
  builds the slice from `text/plain` via `buildPlainTextSlice`,
  which can only produce `paragraph` and `text` nodes.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5 — 2026-05-29

- **Find ordering: document-order-from-cursor, not proximity.**
  `find-replace-plugin.ts`'s `compareByProximity` (nearest-first in both
  directions) is replaced by `compareFromCursor`: matches at/after the
  anchor come first, then those before it, each side ascending by
  document position — i.e. top-to-bottom from the cursor, wrapping to the
  top. Both sort modes use it: `categorized` (Ctrl-F) as the
  within-category tiebreak (after category priority + the cite sub-rank);
  the former `proximity` mode is renamed **`uncategorized`** (Alt-F) and
  is just `compareFromCursor` over the flat match set. `openFindByProximity`
  keeps its command id (so existing rebinds don't orphan) but its label is
  now "Find Without Category Grouping" and `index.ts` opens it with
  `sortMode: 'uncategorized'`; the find-bar mode chip + tooltips updated.

- **Flashcard export / import (Manage flashcards).** `learn-store.ts`
  gains `exportCards()` → `ExportedCard[]` (per card: content + a
  cardId-less `schedule` + its `{ docId, anchor }[]` groundings) and
  `importCards(entries, today)`, which mints a **fresh cardId per entry**
  so import always ADDs (re-importing duplicates, by design; never
  overwrites), carrying the schedule (cardId reassigned) or a fresh one,
  plus anchors. The Manage GUI's bar gets **Import** / **Export** buttons
  over the host `saveAs` / `openFile` JSON pickers (`{ version: 1, cards }`,
  bare array also accepted). `parseImportedCard` / `parseImportedAnchor`
  defensively coerce each untrusted entry (type ∈ qa|cloze, non-empty
  front, well-formed schedule-or-fresh, valid `AnchorDescriptor`-or-null),
  so older/foreign files import cleanly. The open list refreshes via the
  store subscription; no overwrite confirm needed (import is additive).

- **Settings export / import.** `SettingsStore.exportObject()` returns all
  values minus the transient per-window keys and `anthropicApiKey`;
  `replaceAll(raw)` overwrites through the same
  `sanitize({ ...DEFAULTS, ...raw })` boundary as `load` — so it tolerates
  schema drift (added fields → defaults, removed → dropped, bad values
  coerced/clamped) and preserves the current API key + transient values.
  Settings → General gains a "Back up settings" section
  (`buildSettingsBackupSection`) with Export / Import buttons over the host
  `saveAs` / `openFile` JSON pickers (writes `{ version: 1, settings }`,
  also accepts a bare object). Import confirms, runs `replaceAll`, then
  re-renders the dialog so every control reflects the imported values.

- **Settings tab underline no longer clipped when the tab strip scrolls.**
  The active tab's 2px `border-bottom` is pulled 1px below
  `.pmd-settings-tabs`'s content box via `margin-bottom: -1px` (to overlap
  the bar divider). That strip is a horizontal scroll container
  (`overflow: hidden`); at scrollLeft 0 the negative-margin overflow isn't
  clipped, but once `scrollTabIntoView` nudges a mid-strip tab to a
  non-zero scroll the clip drops the underline — so the middle tabs
  (Keyboard, Comments & AI) lost it while the edge tabs kept it. Added
  `padding-bottom: 1px` to the strip so the underline stays inside the
  clip box at any scroll position.

- **Keyboard macros — bind a key to type a snippet.** New
  `keyboardMacros: KeyboardMacro[]` setting (`{ id, key, text }`;
  sanitized; default `[]`). `keyboard-macros.ts`'s `buildMacroKeymap`
  turns the list into a `keymap()` where each key inserts its text at the
  cursor (`tr.insertText`), installed in `buildEditorPlugins` **before**
  the ribbon keymap so a macro key wins over a same-key command. The
  reconfigure subscriber in `index.ts` rebuilds the plugin stack when
  `keyboardMacros` changes (alongside `ribbonKeyOverrides`), so edits take
  effect live without a reload. UI: a "Keyboard macros" section appended
  below the shortcut list in `keybindings-editor.ts`, reusing the
  shortcuts' visual vocabulary so it reads as the same control — section
  title + description use the settings-row classes
  (`.pmd-settings-row-title` / `-desc`) to match the "Keyboard shortcuts"
  heading; the same boxed `.pmd-keybindings-list` container and
  `.pmd-keybinding-row` rows, with the shortcut shown as a
  `.pmd-keybinding-chip` (empty `—` + "+" until set) and the typed-text
  field in the row's flex "label" slot. Key
  capture reuses `ribbonKeyStringFor` + `validateKey`; the text field
  commits on `change` (not per keystroke, to avoid a focus-stealing
  re-render); per-row delete + an "Add macro" button below the box; an
  empty-state row when there are none. Setting a key clears it from any
  other macro (one key = one macro); macro-vs-command conflicts are
  resolved at runtime by plugin order (macro wins), not dislodged.

- **Home screen: number keys 5-7 for the newer action cards.** Extended
  `actionRunners` + the `onKeyDown` digit map (`home-screen.ts`) from 1-4
  to 1-7: 5 = Bulk convert, 6 = Review all, 7 = Manage flashcards. The
  three new runners guard on the same conditions that render their card
  (`callbacks.bulkConvert` present; `learnStore.totalCount > 0`), so a key
  only fires while its button is on screen.

- **Ribbon: Create-flashcard + Ask-AI buttons in the comments group.**
  Both commands were bindable / palette-only; they now have ribbon
  buttons. The comments ops-panel becomes a 2×2 grid (`ribbon-doc-ops-
  panel-2col`): comments-toggle / add-comment on top, create-flashcard /
  ask-ai below. Clicks `preventDefault` on mousedown (keep the selection
  live) and run the bindable command via `runRibbonCommandById`. The
  **Ask-AI** button is hidden unless `aiFeaturesEnabled`
  (`applyAskAiButtonVisibility`, driven by the central `settings.subscribe`
  + an explicit `#ribbon .ribbon-doc-ops-btn[hidden]` rule, since
  `#ribbon button { display: inline-flex }` otherwise defeats `[hidden]`).
  Two new icons (`flashcard` → graduation-hat-02, `ai` → stars-02) added
  to `gen-icons.mjs` + the `IconName` union. Tooltips use sentence-case
  label overrides (`Create flashcard from selection` / `Ask AI about
  selection`) while the command-palette labels stay title-case.

- **Frozen selection: keep the selection painted while the editor is
  blurred.** A contenteditable's native selection vanishes when focus
  leaves it (the command / search palette input, the find bar, etc.), so
  a user who selected text then opened a palette lost sight of it. New
  `frozen-selection-plugin.ts` tracks focus via `blur`/`focus` listeners
  on `view.dom` (a doc-neutral `addToHistory:false` meta) and, while
  blurred, renders an inline decoration over the current `TextSelection`
  with the same tint as the live `::selection` (`.pmd-frozen-selection`,
  accent 30%); cleared on focus so PM's real selection takes back over.
  Registered in `buildEditorPlugins`, so single-doc, multi-pane, and the
  quick-cards editors all get it. Node selections keep their own
  `ProseMirror-selectednode` styling, so the plugin paints text
  selections only.

- **Comments column: one unified card design (comments / flashcards / AI).**
  The three card types had drifted into three visual vocabularies; this
  unifies them.
  - **Type chip.** Every card leads with a shared chip (`makeCardTypeChip`
    → `.pmd-card-type-chip`): `COMMENT` / `Q&A` · `CLOZE` / `AI`, colored
    to mirror the in-text highlight hue (gold / accent / purple).
    Replaces the flashcard's bespoke `.pmd-flashcard-card-badge` and the
    per-turn `.pmd-ai-chip`.
  - **No left borders.** Per-card identity is now a CSS var
    `--pmd-card-accent` (gold / accent / purple) set on the card, driving
    both the chip and the **active** state — which now takes the card's
    own color (border + a same-hue tinted glow) instead of always-blue.
  - **Avatar only when expanded.** Collapsed previews drop the round
    avatar (chip + excerpt + count); the avatar returns when expanded,
    where it separates the thread-opening turn from replies. AI turns
    keep the purple avatar (`pmd-comment-ai`) + persona name; the
    per-turn AI tag is gone (the card chip carries it).
  - **AI opening question renders as root.** `populateAiThread` renders
    the first turn via `renderAiComment(c, isRoot=true)` → un-indented
    `pmd-comment-root` (it begins the conversation); answers + follow-ups
    are `pmd-comment-reply`. Previously every AI turn was a reply, so the
    opening question looked like a reply to nothing.
  - **Delete affordances split by type.** Comment + AI cards get a
    thread-delete `✕` in a shared card header (`buildThreadHeader`);
    comment replies keep a per-reply `✕`; flashcards keep the two-click
    Delete pill. The AI ghost-pill action row is gone — **Convert to
    Flashcard** is promoted to a filled-blue button (`.pmd-ai-convert-btn`)
    below Reply.
  - **Header row + date; send-key input.** The type chip sits in its own
    header row in every state (collapsed too, via `buildThreadHeader`),
    with the card's date right-aligned beside it (comment = root date, AI
    = thread `createdAt`) — the slot the flashcard's status chip occupies.
    The reply / ask / comment submit is now a compact `send-cursor` icon
    button to the right of the textarea (row layout), not a full-width
    button below.
  - Removed `renderAiHeader` / `renderRootHeader` / `buildAiActions` /
    `aiChip`. Unanchored rows unchanged.

- **AI threads → local annotation layer.** Migrated the "Ask AI about
  selection" explainer off comment threads (round-tripping
  `comment_range` marks) onto the same per-user local layer flashcards
  use (SPEC-learn-system §"one local layer"), so AI questions never
  serialize into a shared `.docx`/`.cmir`. Design (per the user):
  **local-only** (like flashcards) and **going-forward only** (existing
  AI *comments* in documents stay as comments; no auto-migration).
  - **Store.** Wired the previously-unused `AiThread` / `LocalComment`
    scaffolding in `learn-store.ts`: added `getAiThread` and
    `appendAiComment` alongside the existing `addAiThread` /
    `setAiThreadAnchor` / `removeAiThread` / `aiThreadsForDoc`. AI threads
    persist in the same host KV blob (`aiThreads[]`) keyed by `docId`.
  - **Anchoring + highlight.** AI threads ground via the shared
    `AnchorDescriptor` (`buildDescriptor`/`resolveDescriptor`) and paint a
    **purple** decoration. The highlight plugin's `FlashcardRange` gained
    a `kind: 'flashcard' | 'ai'` (mapped through edits + the drop-recovery
    re-resolve); `buildDecos` picks `.pmd-ai-range` vs `.pmd-flashcard-range`.
    `comments-ui`'s `refreshFlashcardAnchors` now resolves AI-thread
    anchors too.
  - **Create.** The `aiAskAboutSelection` command (`index.ts`) now mirrors
    `createFlashcard`: build a descriptor, `ensureActiveDocId` +
    `registerDoc` + `stampActiveFileDocId`, `learnStore.addAiThread`, then
    `commentsColumn.activateAiThread`. **No `comment_range` mark.**
  - **Render.** `comments-ui` render() adds AI threads as a third item
    kind in the sorted column list (purple `pmd-ai-card`): producer
    "ask" input when empty, collapsed preview, active conversation
    (`LocalComment[]`) with reply box + two-click delete, plus a
    re-ground row + Unanchored section (mirroring flashcards). AI turns
    show the persona name with initials derived from it (`aiPersonaName`
    / `aiPersonaInitials`) and an **"AI" chip** (`.pmd-ai-chip`) — the
    round-trip-safe `'AI'` initials + `(AI)` name suffix the comment path
    needs are dropped here, since a local thread never serializes so the
    docx-survival heuristic is moot; the chip carries the AI signal.
  - **Model call.** `askAi` records the user's turn then calls
    `invokeAiLocal`, which mirrors the comment-thread `invokeAi` against
    the store `AiThread`: builds the multi-turn message list from
    `LocalComment[]` (user turns → `user`, `ai: true` turns →
    `assistant`, first user turn wrapped in `formatExplainPrompt`), shows
    the Thinking… placeholder + Clod activity ticker while in-flight, and
    `appendAiComment`s the reply as an `ai: true` turn. Context is cached
    at activation from the original selection (`buildExplainContext`,
    captured before scroll moves the caret), with `contextFromAiThread`
    (resolve the anchor → range → context) as the post-reload fallback.
    Reply turns re-invoke automatically (it's an AI thread).
  - **Convert to Flashcard.** Active AI cards get a **Convert to
    Flashcard** action (beside Delete). It asks the model for one card
    (Q&A or cloze) capturing the thread's line of inquiry, then opens the
    create-flashcard editor pre-populated so the user edits/confirms; the
    new card grounds to the **same** selection as the AI question
    (`setAnchor(cardId, thread.docId, thread.anchor)`). New module
    `ai/flashcard-gen.ts` holds the research-grounded `FLASHCARD_SYSTEM_
    PROMPT`, `formatFlashcardPrompt` (highlight + card context + the
    conversation, with the user's questions called out as the angle
    signal and the AI replies demoted to background), and a tolerant
    `parseFlashcardReply` (extracts the outermost `{...}`, validates type
    / non-empty front / Q&A-needs-back). The prompt is built from the
    `reference-docs/mnemonic-medium/` corpus: it leans on the highlight +
    questions + card tag as the signal of what the user wants reinforced
    ("highlights → interests"), defaults to Q&A over cloze, and names the
    five `probes/` pathologies (shallow / narrow / wordy / lacks-context
    / solicits-multiple-responses) plus the positive attributes as
    explicit constraints — atomicity foregrounded as the top rule (one
    fact per card; no compound "and"/list/fact-plus-reason cards) with
    the binary Remembered/Forgot grading as the rationale; richness goes
    in separate cards. Then self-contained, unambiguous, deep, concise.
  - **Cleanup.** Removed the now-dead comment-based AI creation path:
    `addAiThreadFromSelection` and the `pendingAiFirst` machinery (its
    only writer) — `renderPrimaryInput` / `commitRootText` lose their
    AI-specific branches. The `@AI`-mention-in-a-comment path (a separate
    surface) is unchanged and still uses the comment-thread `invokeAi`.

- **Paste stamps fresh heading ids (nav pane works on pasted sections).**
  The heading nodes (pocket/hat/block/tag/analytic) carry a stable `id`
  that the nav pane keys expand/collapse, jump-to, and the 1/2/3/4 level
  filter off of — but the schema's `parseDOM.getAttrs` reads only
  `indent`, never `data-id`, so PM's clipboard parser returns pasted
  headings with `id: null`. Drag-copy / dropzone / send-to-speech all
  call `rewriteHeadingIds` to keep ids unique, but paste had no
  equivalent, so pasted pockets/hats/blocks/tags were id-less and inert
  in the destination outline (permanently expanded, un-jumpable, ignored
  by the level filter). `rewriteHeadingIds` couldn't be reused as-is — it
  only rewrites *existing* non-null ids — so `drag-controller.ts` now
  factors the slice walk into `mapSliceIds(slice, predicate)` behind two
  exports: `rewriteHeadingIds` (assign when the node already has a
  non-empty id) and the new `freshHeadingIds` (assign to every id-bearing
  node, filling nulls). The paste plugin gains a `transformPasted` prop
  that runs `freshHeadingIds` — it fires inside PM's `parseFromClipboard`
  before `handlePaste` sees the slice, so the tag/analytic split and
  card-body paths get fresh ids too. The `parseHeadFromHTML` fallback
  (which re-parses the raw clipboard HTML and so bypasses
  `transformPasted`) stamps its reconstructed head directly.

- **Drag-and-drop now jumps to the dropped section like a nav-pane
  click.** Before, every drop path in `drag-controller.ts` ended in
  `tr.scrollIntoView()` over a transaction that never set a selection —
  so PM scrolled to the *default mapped selection* (the pre-drag caret,
  shifted by the move's delete+insert), which only coincidentally pointed
  at the moved content. Two parts to the fix: (1) `buildMoveTransaction` /
  `buildCopyTransaction` capture the first-insert position and end with a
  shared `selectTopOfInsert(tr, insertStart)` helper — `tr.setSelection(
  Selection.near(tr.doc.resolve(insertStart), 1))` — putting the caret at
  the top of the dropped content (its first heading); the cross-view /
  virtual-source (dropzone shelf) path applies the same helper to its
  inline insert transaction. (2) After dispatching the drop transaction
  (no more `tr.scrollIntoView()`), `scrollToDroppedTop(view)` resolves the
  DOM element at the new selection and `preciseScrollIntoView`s it — the
  identical primitive `nav-panel.ts`'s `jumpTo` uses, which re-measures /
  converges (handling `content-visibility: auto` undershoot) and pins the
  heading to the top of the viewport, rather than PM's `scrollIntoView`
  which only guarantees the caret lands somewhere on screen at an
  inconsistent offset. The same-view move path also now `focus()`es the
  source view after dispatch (the cross-view path already did) so PM
  syncs the DOM caret to the transaction's selection — otherwise the
  state selection was correct but the *visible* cursor stayed wherever it
  was before the drag. End result: a drop leaves both the viewport and
  the caret exactly where clicking that heading in the outline would.
  `Selection` is now a value import from `prosemirror-state`;
  `drag-controller.ts` now imports `preciseScrollIntoView`.

- **Nav-pane caret highlight re-applies after the debounced rebuild.**
  `dispatchTransaction` calls `navPanel.setCaretHeading(selection.from)`
  synchronously, but that scans `liEntries`' *cached* positions — which
  only refresh in the debounced `scheduleHeavyUpdate` → `navPanel.update`
  (~200ms). For small edits the drift is harmless (the comment on
  `setCaretHeading` already notes this), but a structural change like a
  drag-move leaves the wrong heading highlighted, and `update()` never
  re-ran the highlight, so it stayed wrong until the next caret movement.
  The heavy-update callback now calls `setCaretHeading(selection.from)`
  immediately after `navPanel.update`, against the freshly-rebuilt
  positions, so the highlight self-corrects. Single-doc path only; the
  multi-pane per-pane nav doesn't track the caret highlight at all.

- **Nav-pane double-click (collapse toggle) no longer relies on the
  native `dblclick`.** A plain nav click's `jumpTo` dispatches a
  selection-only transaction; `dispatchTransaction` then scheduled the
  debounced `scheduleHeavyUpdate` → `navPanel.update()` → `render()`,
  which does `listEl.innerHTML = ''` and rebuilds every `<li>`. Because
  `scheduleIdle` (requestIdleCallback) fires in the idle gap *between*
  the two clicks of a double, the clicked `<li>` was usually gone before
  the second click — and `dblclick` only fires when both clicks share a
  target node, so the collapse toggle silently dropped. (A regression
  since the heavy flush moved from a fixed 200ms `setTimeout` to idle
  dispatch in alpha.1; the multi-pane code even had a comment warning a
  per-keystroke rebuild "would invalidate any dblclick in progress".)
  Two-part fix: (1) the nav pane detects double-clicks itself in
  `onDragUp` — `handlePlainClickDouble(entry)` matches `entry.id` +
  timestamp (`NAV_DOUBLE_CLICK_MS`, 500ms) across two plain clicks and
  toggles via `toggleCollapsed` when the id is in a per-render
  `collapsibleIds` set; keying on the stable id rather than the DOM node
  makes it immune to the `<li>` being recreated between clicks. (2) Both
  `dispatchTransaction`s (single-doc and the multi-pane per-pane view)
  now gate the heavy flush on `tx.docChanged`, so a selection-only jump
  doesn't rebuild the outline at all — killing the mid-gesture re-render
  (and an O(doc) nav rebuild on every cursor move). The native `dblclick`
  listener is removed.

- **Comments column: Docs-like reflow layout.** `comments-ui.ts`'s
  `render()` no longer wipes + rebuilds the card DOM each pass — it
  reconciles a persistent `Map<threadId, element>` (and `fc:<cardId>`
  for flashcards), gated by a content signature so a card is
  re-populated only when its content / active state actually changed
  (the active reply textarea keeps focus + value across unrelated
  renders). A per-card `ResizeObserver` reflows the whole stack whenever
  any card's height changes (expand/collapse, AI text streaming in,
  reply box), and `top` animates (`transition`, suppressed on first
  placement via `pmd-card-settled`) so cards glide around each other
  rather than snapping. Fixes the previous one-shot layout that froze
  positions until the next debounced render. This is the shared layout
  the flashcard cards plug into.

- **Learn: create→review loop over a local annotation layer.** First
  user-facing slice of the spaced-repetition system (SPEC-learn-system).
  Flashcards never enter the document — they live in a per-user
  `LearnStore` (`learn-store.ts`) persisted as a single host KV blob
  (`learn-store-host.ts` → `read/writeLearnStore`), keyed by a stable
  per-document id.
  - **Identity.** A document carries a hidden `cmirDocId`: a `.cmir`
    field and, for `.docx`, a custom document property
    (`docProps/custom.xml`) that survives a real Word round-trip. The
    store splits identity so file-copies share one logical card + one
    schedule while each file keeps its own grounding: `CardDef` +
    `ScheduleEntry` per `cardId`; `CardAnchor` per (`cardId`,`docId`).
    Create Flashcard also stamps the id straight into the on-disk file
    (`stampActiveFileDocId` — reads the file, `stampDocId`, writes back),
    so a card made in a file CardMirror didn't author re-associates on
    reload without a manual save (no-op on web / never-saved docs / files
    that already carry an id).
    The docId is resolved mode-agnostically so single-doc and multi-pane
    behave identically: `index.ts` keeps `activeDocIdentity()` (focused
    `DocRecord`'s `{docId, uid}` or the single-doc globals),
    `ensureActiveDocId()` (mint + rekey the session uid), and
    `setActiveDocId()` (write back, in multi-pane via the
    `setFocusedDocId` shell hook). It's read from the file on open,
    backfilled on save, persisted on every save / autosave / journal
    write (so an autosave never strips identity), restored through crash
    recovery, and forked on a full Save As (`copyDocAnnotations`).
  - **Create Flashcard.** New ribbon command (`createFlashcard`, in the
    Learn group; reachable from the command palette) anchors a card to
    the selection: `buildDescriptor` (`learn-anchor.ts`, Hypothesis-style
    quote+context+position) captures the grounding, `learn-create-ui.ts`
    collects Q&A or cloze content, and the store gets a `CardDef` +
    due-today `ScheduleEntry` + `CardAnchor` keyed to
    `activeAnnotationDocId()`.
  - **Review.** `learn-session-ui.ts` is a full-screen overlay driven by
    `learnStore.queue(scope, today)`. Front → reveal → binary grade;
    grading goes through the Orbit-style scheduler (`learn-scheduler.ts`,
    binary interval ladder, no ease factor) which reports
    `retryInSession`, so a forgotten card is re-queued for later in the
    same session while its schedule is updated and persisted per grade.
    Cloze cards blank `{{deletion}}` on the front and highlight it on the
    reveal.
  - **Home Learn section.** `home-screen.ts` rebuilds from the store (on
    change + each show): "Review all due" + "Manage cards" cards plus a
    per-file / per-deck breakdown of scopes with cards due today, each
    opening a scoped session.
  - **Manage flashcards.** `learn-manage-ui.ts` (the `manageFlashcards`
    command, or the Home button) lists every card grouped by the file
    it's anchored to — built from new store reads `listCards()` /
    `listAnchors()` — with a text filter, a show-suspended toggle, and
    per-card edit (reuses `openCardEditor` with an `initial`),
    suspend/resume (`setSuspended`), and a two-click delete
    (`deleteCard`; native confirm is unavailable in Electron). A **New
    card** action creates a standalone card with no `CardAnchor` (still
    scheduled + reviewable under the 'all' scope). Cards shared across
    files are flagged; an "Unanchored" group collects standalone cards
    and any whose anchor is gone. Each unanchored card has a **link**
    button (new `link` icon): pick a file, and the card gets a
    file-level `CardAnchor` (null text anchor — grounded to text later
    from inside the file). Reading/assigning the file's identity uses
    new package helpers `readDocIdFromBytes` / `stampDocId`
    (`src/docid.ts`) — for a file with no id, one is minted and stamped
    in losslessly (`.docx` via `Docx.load → writeDocId → toBuffer`, no
    content re-render; `.cmir` via a minimal JSON field edit) and written
    back with `saveExisting`, so a future open re-associates. `openCreateFlashcard` was generalized to
    `openCardEditor({ selectedText? , initial? })` to serve both create
    and edit.
  - **In-context (comments column).** Anchored flashcards render in the
    comments column alongside genuine comments. The in-doc highlight is a
    **view-only decoration** (`learn-highlight-plugin.ts`,
    `.pmd-flashcard-range`), never a `comment_range` mark — so a card's
    grounding can't leak into a shared file by construction (no
    serialize-strip needed at any of the ~4 save sites). The plugin maps
    ranges through edits (bias from→right / to→left, matching
    `inclusive:false`) and drops a fully-deleted span. `comments-ui.ts`
    resolves each card's descriptor against the live doc lazily — on
    column open (SPEC §4.2), doc load (`mountView` rAF), multi-pane focus
    switch (`focusSlot`), and any store change while open — via
    `refreshFlashcardAnchors`, hands resolved ranges to the plugin
    (`setFlashcardRangesTr`), and renders flashcard cards positioned by
    those ranges (synthetic `fc:<cardId>` ids merged into the layout
    map). Unresolved cards (foreign edit / linked-but-not-grounded) go to
    a collapsible **"Unanchored (n)"** section pinned at the pane bottom
    (`positionUnanchored`) showing `anchor.quote` + a **Re-ground** button
    (`buildDescriptor` from the current selection → `setAnchor`). Each
    card has Edit / Suspend / Delete. A broken anchor never touches the
    card's schedule or file association (the store is never mutated by
    edit-tracking; "unanchored" is derived from non-resolution).
    Resolution gates on context, not just the quote: `resolveDescriptor`
    scores every quote hit (even a lone one) by how much its surroundings
    overlap the stored prefix/suffix and **rejects** the best (→ null →
    Unanchored) unless it clears `MIN_CONTEXT_FRACTION` (⅓) of the
    available context (`avail = min(prefix,CONTEXT)+min(suffix,CONTEXT)`),
    so a card whose anchored text was deleted unanchors instead of
    grounding onto a coincidental same-words hit elsewhere; one intact
    side clears the bar, and quotes near a doc boundary aren't
    over-penalized. `CONTEXT` is 60 chars each side.
  - Deferred: refreshing a descriptor from its live range on save (§4.2 —
    editing the *quoted text* unanchors on reload; re-resolution covers
    moves, re-ground covers the rest), deck management, and migrating
    Ask-AI threads into the local layer.

- **Command palette: file search (`f` prefix) — a first slice of corpus
  search.** Two on-demand stages, no persistent index yet (see
  ARCHITECTURE.md §11):
  - **File stage.** `f <query>` lists `.cmir` files under the new
    `fileSearchRoot` folder setting via `host:list-cmir-files` (cached —
    see the file-index note below), matched on filename with the same
    token-substring ranking the rest of the palette uses. The listing is
    held for the palette session; an `asyncToken` guards against stale
    list/read results from a prior query or a closed palette. Enter opens
    the file through `openFileByPath` → `routeOpenedFile` (extracted from
    `runOpenFlow`): the cross-window dup guard, then spawn-a-new-window
    (single-doc) or the slot picker (multi-pane), so it never overwrites
    the current window's doc.
  - **Within-file stage.** Tab on a highlighted file reads + `parseNative`s
    it once, runs `extractFile` (new `file-search.ts`), and enters a
    sticky in-file mode (the bar clears, prefix parsing is bypassed, Esc
    restores the prior file query). `extractFile` returns both an
    `outline` (the full pocket→hat→block→tag hierarchy with levels) and
    flat searchable `objects` (the enabled kinds + cites), reusing
    `collectHeadings` + `computeHeadingRange`. An **empty** query browses
    the outline — rendered indented, nav-pane style, in full (no 50-cap),
    cites excluded since they aren't headings; a non-empty query runs the
    flat object search. Insert granularity is whatever
    `computeHeadingRange` gives: tag/cite → the card, block/hat/pocket →
    the heading + its section, analytic → its unit. The parsed doc is
    kept on the in-file state and slices are taken **lazily** on insert
    (`doc.slice(from, to)`, same schema — no eager per-heading slicing or
    JSON round-trip), which also keeps the dive cheap. Inserts go through
    `insertSpeechSlice`, like quick cards.
  - **Collapsible outline.** The browse is collapsible: each pocket/hat/
    block carries a chevron (and the row's right-click toggles), hiding
    its subtree via a single-boundary visibility walk over the flat
    outline. The initial collapsed set is seeded from a new
    `fileSearchOutlineDepth` setting (default 3 = blocks shown, tags
    collapsed), mirroring the nav pane's `navMaxLevel`; collapse state
    lives on the in-file state and survives toggling between browse and
    search within a dive.
  - **Settings.** `fileSearchRoot` (folder), `fileSearchObjectTypes`
    (checklist; default block/tag/cite), and `fileSearchOutlineDepth`
    (Pocket/Hat/Block/Tag segmented control; default Block) under
    General, all Electron-only.
  - **Multi-grab.** Inserting a within-file object keeps the palette open
    and the parsed file in memory, so you can pull several blocks in a
    row (the parse cost is paid once per Tab, not per insert). Toast +
    bar refocus happen in the `afterInsert` hook (after the deferred
    insert's own `speechView.focus()`), and Ctrl/Cmd+Z / Shift+Z / Y are
    routed to the editor's `undo`/`redo` from the bar so a misfire can be
    taken back without leaving it. Other sources still close on insert.
  - **Pinned files — a warm working set.** A small curated set of files
    is kept "warm" (parsed `doc` + extracted objects/outline held in a
    module-level `warmCache` in the renderer) so dives into them skip the
    read+parse and are instant. Two kinds of pins:
    - *Manual* (★ on a file row / **Alt+P** on the selected one): shown
      with a solid star and floated to the top of `f`. Stored in a new
      `pins-store.ts` (localStorage, like `recents-store` — durable +
      cross-window without IPC).
    - *Auto* (silent): recents (top 6) ∪ frequents (used ≥ 2×, top 10),
      capped at 10 total; manual pins are exempt from the cap. Gated by
      the `pinAutoEnabled` setting (default on) for memory-sensitive users.
    The warm cache is keyed by path + `mtimeMs` (carried on `FileEntry`
    from `host:list-cmir-files`) with an `enabledSig` so a change to the
    searchable-object set re-extracts from the cached doc without
    re-parsing. The warm pass — `runWarmPass()`, a module-level function
    shared by the open palette and a proactive boot-time pre-warm — walks
    the effective set sequentially, **yielding to an idle slot
    (`scheduleIdle`) before each synchronous `parseNative`** so a `.docx`
    parse never lands on a keystroke (the renderer defers idle callbacks
    until the user pauses). It runs two ways: `prewarmQuickCardFiles()`
    fires once at boot (scheduled on idle), listing + warming the set
    before the palette is ever opened — so the first search finds files
    already cached rather than parsing on the first keystroke; and the
    open palette re-runs it when its file list loads (with a `keepGoing`
    guard so it bails if the palette closes). Both skip already-fresh
    files and prune rotated-out pins. A dive uses a warm hit when the
    mtime matches, else reads/parses and warms it if pinned. Usage is
    recorded on open + dive (feeds frequents). All renderer-side — no
    main-process store, no parser refactor (see
    reference-docs/SPEC-pinned-files.md).

  - **Cached file index (main process).** `host:list-cmir-files` caches
    the recursive `.cmir` listing — with per-file mtime + size — in
    memory and on disk (`{userData}/cmir-file-index.json`), returning
    instantly and revalidating the tree in the background (coalesced
    per root, rewritten only when it changed). Replaces the per-palette
    directory walk; the stored mtimes set up the future content index's
    reparse-only-what-changed pass. Files now also join the no-prefix
    "search everything" (the scan is kicked off lazily and folded in
    once ready).

- **Fix: palette commands that open a prompt (e.g. New Speech Document)
  did nothing.** The Enter that ran the command bubbled to `document`,
  where the just-opened `promptForText` modal had synchronously
  registered its keydown listener — which caught that same Enter and
  instantly submitted itself with an empty value. The palette's Enter
  now `stopPropagation()`s, so it can't leak into a modal the command
  spawns. (Ribbon buttons were unaffected — a click has no Enter to
  bleed.)

- **Search palette: a settings source (`s` prefix).** The command
  palette gains a fourth source alongside quick cards (`q`), the
  dropzone (`d`), and commands (`c`): settings (`s`), also folded into
  the no-prefix "search everything". `searchSettingsSource` surfaces
  two kinds of rows — the top-level tabs from `CATEGORY_TABS` (opening
  the tab) and every individual setting from `SETTING_METADATA` (opening
  its tab and scrolling to it), ranked by where the query hits the
  label and respecting `electronOnly` so web never offers a row that
  won't render. Selecting a settings row calls a new
  `openSettings(target)` overload; `SettingsModal.open` then activates
  the target tab and `revealSetting` scrolls the row (now tagged with
  `data-setting-key`) into view and runs a one-shot highlight
  animation. Rows carry a `SET` badge.

- **Fix: the save button's icon vanished after the saved-✓ flash.**
  `flashSavedGlyph` swapped the button's `textContent` to `✓` and back,
  which worked when the glyph was text but wiped the new icon `<span>`
  for good once the chrome moved to masked icons. It now snapshots and
  restores the button's inner markup (via a `flashOrigHtml` WeakMap),
  so the floppy-disk icon returns after the flash in both icon modes.

- **Icon system: Untitled UI line icons with a Modern/Classic toggle.**
  The app chrome's glyphs (ribbon buttons, the speech-doc banner,
  dialog close/reset/reorder buttons, status-bar zoom, nav-tree
  chevrons, etc.) were a mix of emoji and Unicode symbols that rendered
  inconsistently across platforms and ignored the theme. They're now a
  single line-icon set drawn from the Untitled UI free icons.
  - **Mechanism.** Each icon is a `<span class="pmd-icon pmd-icon-NAME">`
    painted in `currentColor` via a CSS `mask` whose image is a
    data-URL SVG (so the icon inherits text color and theme for free).
    `scripts/gen-icons.mjs` reads the source SVGs from the gitignored
    `reference-docs/untitled-ui-icons` clone and generates the
    committed `src/editor/icons.css` (the app ships self-contained — no
    SVG files at runtime). The generator's `MAP` pairs each pmd icon
    name with its Untitled UI filename and a classic-fallback glyph.
    `src/editor/icons.ts` exposes `icon(name)` / `setIcon(el, name)` for
    JS-created buttons; static markup uses the span directly.
  - **Toggle.** A new `iconSet: 'modern' | 'classic'` setting (default
    `'modern'`) resolves to a `data-icons` attribute on the document
    root, applied at boot and on change (`applyIconSet` in index.ts,
    alongside the theme/motion appliers). `icons.css` masks the SVG
    under `[data-icons="modern"]`; under `"classic"` it drops the mask
    and renders the original emoji/text glyph via `::before`, releasing
    the fixed 1em box so wide emoji size and center exactly as the old
    text nodes did. The setting lives under Appearance as a two-button
    segmented control parallel to the theme picker.
  - **Licensing.** Untitled UI's free icons are © Untitled UI, used
    under their free license (not MIT, despite the upstream package's
    metadata). Attribution and the license terms are recorded in a new
    `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, referenced from `LICENSE` and the README;
    the generator/CSS headers point there too. The upstream `.svg`
    files and the set as a whole stay in the gitignored reference clone
    and are not committed — only the specific glyphs the app uses are
    baked into `icons.css`.

- **Dropzone moved to the editor's bottom-left corner.** It used to be
  pinned at the bottom of the nav pane, where dragging onto it landed
  in the outline list's auto-scroll zone and scrolled the outline.
  Now a SINGLE `DropzoneController` is mounted at boot (index.ts) into
  `document.body`, `position: fixed`, with `positionDropzone()`
  anchoring it to the editor element's live rect — `#app` in
  single-doc (so it tracks nav-width / status-bar / nav-hidden), the
  leftmost visible `.pmd-pane-body` in multi-pane. Repositioned on
  window resize + a `ResizeObserver` on `#app` + after the multi-pane
  shell mounts. `getFocusedView` now resolves via `getActiveView()`.
  Removed the per-nav-panel `installDropzone` (was one pill per
  nav-pane) and the nav-list's bottom-padding reserve.
  - **Scroll runway under the pill.** The pill floats over the editor's
    bottom-left, covering content there with no way to scroll it clear at
    the doc's end. The fix is a fixed `padding-bottom: 4.5rem` on the
    editable (`#editor .ProseMirror`), gated on
    `html:not(.pmd-dropzone-pill-hidden)` (single-doc) — this extends the
    doc content's own height, the same thing that drives `#app`'s scroll
    for any long doc, so the last line scrolls clear of the pill. (Earlier
    attempts — padding the flex item `.pmd-editor-row`, a JS-measured
    `--pmd-dropzone-runway`, and a dedicated spacer flex child of `#app` —
    didn't reliably extend the scroll area; padding the content does.)
  - **Palette gating.** The command palette's dropzone source (`d`
    prefix, its empty-state hint, and inclusion in "search everything")
    now appears only when the dropzone is on (`showDropzonePill`); typing
    `d ` while it's off shows an "it's off" hint instead.

- **Bulk convert utility (desktop).** Home-screen button in its own
  labeled "Convert" group beside the Quick Cards group (shown only when
  `getHost().kind === 'electron'`), opening `bulk-convert-ui.ts`'s
  modal. Two toggles — direction (`.docx`→`.cmir` / reverse) and output
  (loose files vs a single `.zip`) — both written into a chosen
  destination folder. Separate input (file / folder) + destination
  pickers, with the chosen paths shown and a Convert button enabled
  once both are set; changing direction clears the picked input.
  - Conversion (`convertBytes`): docx→cmir = `fromDocxFull` →
    `serializeNative`; cmir→docx = `parseNative` → `toDocx`. Threads
    (comments) preserved.
  - Both output forms write into the destination via `writeFileAtPath`:
    loose files keep the input's relative subfolder structure (swapped
    extension); a zip is written as `<inputName>.zip`. File input uses
    `host.openFile` (scoped to the source ext); folder input is recursed
    via the new `host.listFilesRecursive(dir, ext)`, each file read,
    converted, then written / added to a JSZip; failures counted, not
    fatal.
  - New main IPC + host methods: `host:list-files-recursive` (recursive
    `readdir` by extension) and `host:write-file-at-path` (now mkdir-ps
    the parent so nested + destination writes work).
  - The modal's Escape handler (a capture-phase `document` keydown)
    `stopPropagation()`s so closing the dialog doesn't also reach the
    home screen's bubble-phase keydown and dismiss Home underneath it.

- **Quick Cards — store foundation (no UI yet).** First slice of the
  Quick Cards feature (see `reference-docs/SPEC-quick-cards.md`): a
  persistent, cross-window library of reusable rich-text snippets.
  - `src/editor/quick-cards-store.ts` — dual-backend reactive store
    (`quickCardsStore`) mirroring `dropzone-store.ts` but persistent.
    `QuickCard` shape: id (UUID), name, tags, `contentJson`
    (`Slice.toJSON()`), denormalized search keys
    (`nameLower`/`tagsLower`/`textLower`), `sourceName` provenance,
    created/updated (epoch ms). API: `init` / `list` / `byId` /
    `upsert` / `importMany` / `remove` / `clear` / `subscribe`, plus
    `normalizeTag` + `tagSetKey` helpers for the (forthcoming)
    duplicate-name-only-if-tags-differ rule. Electron backend reads
    main + subscribes to `quick-cards:changed`; web backend uses
    `localStorage` (persists across sessions, unlike the dropzone's
    sessionStorage) + a `storage` listener.
  - Host layer: `quickCardsList/Upsert/BulkUpsert/Remove/Clear` +
    `onQuickCardsChanged` on `ElectronHost` (+ a local `QuickCardIpc`
    type) and the preload bridge.
  - Main process (`apps/desktop/src/main.ts`): authoritative
    `quickCards` array persisted to `{userData}/quick-cards.json`
    (lazy load, atomic tmp→rename writes serialized on a write-tail,
    same discipline as the journal) and broadcast to every window on
    mutation. New IPC: `host:quick-cards-list/upsert/bulk-upsert/
    remove/clear`.
  - Boot: `quickCardsStore.init()` runs at renderer startup so every
    surface reads one cache.

- **Quick Cards — Add surface.** Second slice: capture the current
  selection as a named, tagged quick card.
  - New `addQuickCard` ribbon command (unbound by default; in the new
    "Quick Cards" `RIBBON_GROUPS` entry, so bindable via Settings →
    Keybindings). Registered through the full pipeline (union, ids,
    label, empty default key, `RibbonContext` + stub, `commandFor`).
  - `runAddQuickCard` (index.ts): requires a non-empty selection
    (toast otherwise); pre-fills the name with the **smallest enclosing
    heading** via `smallestEnclosingHeadingText` (nearest preceding
    block → hat → pocket — that nearest heading IS the smallest
    enclosing one); opens the dialog; on confirm builds the card from
    the selection slice (`slice.toJSON()` + plain-text key) and
    `upsert`s it. `sourceName` = the active filename (provenance).
  - `quick-card-add-ui.ts`: promise-based modal (Save As scaffolding)
    with a name field + a tag chip-input (commit on Enter/comma,
    remove via × / Backspace, suggestions drawn from existing tags).
    Enforces the **(name, identical tag-set)** uniqueness rule through
    an inline validator (`findDuplicate`); a name may repeat only if
    its tags differ.
  - Store helpers added: `buildQuickCard`, `distinctTags`,
    `findDuplicate`. CSS: `.pmd-qc-add-*`.

- **Quick Cards — Manage overlay.** Third slice: a full-window
  master/detail surface (`quick-cards-manage-ui.ts`, `quickCardsManageUI`).
  - List (left): every card with name, tags, source file; filter box
    (multi-token substring over name/tags/text), sort (recently
    updated / name / source), per-row checkbox for multi-select →
    bulk Export / Delete.
  - Detail (right): edit name + tags (chip input reusing the Add
    dialog's `.pmd-qc-add-*` classes) and content in an **embedded
    `EditorView`** (shared `schema` + `buildEditorPlugins()`,
    dynamic-imported from index.js to dodge the import cycle). The
    editor is seeded by inserting the stored slice into an empty doc
    (`replaceSelection`, robust for open/inline slices); Save extracts
    it back via `slice.toJSON()` + a trailing-empty-paragraph trim,
    re-checks the (name, tag-set) uniqueness rule (`findDuplicate`,
    excluding self), and `upsert`s. Delete removes.
  - Export (selected or all) / Import via the host file pickers as
    **plain JSON** (`{version,cards}`); import re-mints ids ("import as
    new", never overwrites). No custom extension.
  - Live-syncs from the store while open, but **preserves an
    in-progress edit** — an external library change re-renders the
    list but only rebuilds the detail editor when nothing is unsaved
    (and resets only if the open card was deleted).
  - Entry points: the 🗂️ Manage ribbon button (was a stub) and a new
    **Quick Cards** section on the Home screen (below Recent, above
    the forthcoming Learn section). CSS: `.pmd-qc-manage-*`.
  - Known v1 limitation: the embedded editor uses base ProseMirror
    styling (it's not under `#editor`, so per-style size/font
    variables don't cascade) — content is fully editable, just not a
    pixel match for the main editor.
  - Re-entrancy fix: every Electron mutation fires the store
    subscription twice (optimistic + main broadcast echo); with the
    detail's editor mount being async (dynamic import), two renders
    interleaved and double-appended the footer (and left stale DOM).
    `renderDetail` now appends all DOM (incl. footer) synchronously and
    guards the async editor mount with a `renderSeq` token, so stale
    mounts are discarded.
  - The Add dialog now offers **"Open it"** on a duplicate (same name +
    identical tags): `openQuickCardAdd` takes `findConflict` +
    `onOpenConflict`, the latter opening the Manage overlay at that card
    (`quickCardsManageUI.open({ selectId })`).
  - Ribbon: a 2×2 Quick Cards cluster (`#quickcards-stack`) between the
    speech stack and the formatting panel, shown in both single- and
    multi-doc (unlike the speech stack). Buttons: 🔍 Search · 🏷️ Tag
    Picker (top), 🗂️ Manage · ➕ Add (bottom). `mousedown`
    preventDefault on all four preserves the editor selection. CSS
    `.ribbon-quickcards-stack` mirrors the speech stack.

- **Quick Cards — Search palette + Tag Picker (feature complete).**
  - `quick-cards-match.ts`: pure Block-Search matcher
    (`searchQuickCards`) — order-independent multi-token substring AND,
    scoped by the active-tags filter (`isInScope`: empty filter = all;
    else ≥1 active tag; untagged always in scope), two-tier (name
    matches, then content-only matches with a ~40-char snippet of the
    matched region). Name tier ordered by first-token position then
    recency; content tier by recency.
  - `quick-card-search-ui.ts`: the floating palette (`quickCardSearchUI`)
    — centered over the target pane, pinned bottom, results ABOVE the
    bar; input focused synchronously; one-shot blue pulse
    (`pmd-qcs-pulse`, auto-suppressed by the reduce-motion rule);
    live search; ↑/↓ nav, Enter = insert at cursor, Alt+Enter = at
    end, Tab = inline tag filter, Esc/click-away to close; keyboard
    hints footer; no-editable-target → toast, no insert. Insert
    reuses `insertSpeechSlice` with the new mid-text-confirm option
    gated on `quickCardSkipMidTextInsertConfirm`. Also exports
    `openQuickCardTagPicker` (the ribbon 🏷️ dropdown) — both it and
    the inline Tab filter edit the global `quickCardActiveTags` setting.
  - `insertSpeechSlice` gained a 5th `midTextConfirm: { enabled,
    message? }` param (defaults preserve speech-doc behavior).
  - Command `openQuickCardSearch` (`Mod-Shift-Space`), registered +
    view-less (opens browse-only with no doc). 🔍 and 🏷️ ribbon
    buttons wired (were stubs); ➕ Add unchanged.
  - Settings: `quickCardActiveTags` (the global tag filter; edited via
    the Tag Picker, not a settings row) and
    `quickCardSkipMidTextInsertConfirm` (Editing tab, default off).
  - Prefix system (first slice of the eventual full set): `parsePrefix`
    splits a leading `q `/`d `/`c ` off the query. `q ` searches quick
    cards, `d ` the dropzone, `c ` **commands** (`searchCommandSource`
    — multi-token substring over `RIBBON_COMMAND_LABELS`, showing the
    command's current keybinding; activating runs it via the new
    `runRibbonCommandById` passed in as `opts.runCommand`, which is
    view-less-aware). No prefix searches EVERYTHING (cards + dropzone +
    commands) but shows nothing until the user types. Results are a
    unified `PaletteResult` (source badge QC/DZ/CMD); quickcard/dropzone
    insert their `sliceJson`, commands run their `commandId`.
  - Re-triggering the open hotkey while open toggles the palette
    closed. The bar sits higher (`bottom: 6rem`) and its width clamps
    to the target pane (`min(540, paneWidth − 24)`, floor 240) so it
    shrinks gracefully in narrow / multi-pane windows; hints wrap.
  - The tag picker (inline + ribbon popover) is keyboard-navigable:
    auto-selects the best match, ↑/↓ move, Enter toggles, Tab /
    Shift-Tab / Esc return to the query.

- **Select Current Heading / Copy Current Heading commands.** Two new
  ribbon commands (`selectCurrentHeading`, `copyCurrentHeading`) that
  reuse the send-to-speech / send-to-dropzone cursor→bounds logic.
  Refactored that logic in `speech-doc-send.ts` into a shared
  `enclosingStructureRange(doc, $pos)` (the enclosing `card` /
  `analytic_unit` / heading + everything up to the next
  equal-or-shallower heading), with two callers:
  `resolveSendRange` (selection if non-empty, else the enclosing
  structure — unchanged send-to-* behavior; `resolveSendSlice` slices
  over it) and `resolveCursorStructureRange` (always the cursor's
  structure, **ignoring any selection**, keyed off `selection.$head`).
  Select/copy use the latter — a pre-existing selection is irrelevant
  to them (re-selecting it is a no-op, and Ctrl+C copies it). Select
  dispatches a `TextSelection.between(from, to)` (+ `scrollIntoView`,
  refocus); Copy serializes the range's slice to HTML + plain text and
  writes the clipboard without disturbing the selection (same
  serialization the nav pane's copy-heading uses). Source-only
  operations on the focused `view`, so no multi-doc routing. Registered
  through the full pipeline (id union, `RIBBON_COMMAND_IDS`, labels,
  `DEFAULT_RIBBON_KEYS` empty = unbound, `RibbonContext` + stub,
  `commandFor`, `RIBBON_GROUPS` "Editing utilities"); rebindable via
  Settings → Keybindings.

- **Fixed: large `.docx` files failing to import with "Entity
  expansion limit exceeded: N > 1000".** `src/ooxml/parse.ts`
  configures `fast-xml-parser`, whose entity-expansion guard (added
  in the 4.5.x security hardening) defaults to
  `maxTotalExpansions: 1000`. That counter increments per match for
  *every* entity replaced — including the standard XML entities
  (`&amp; &lt; &gt; &quot; &apos;`) — cumulatively across the whole
  `document.xml`, reset only per parse. Large debate docs blow past
  1000 standard entities easily, so the parse threw before the
  importer ever ran (no ProseMirror involvement — this is upstream
  of the editor entirely). Fix: pass `processEntities` as an object
  with `maxTotalExpansions: Infinity` / `maxExpandedLength: Infinity`.
  Safe because (a) standard entities and numeric char-refs are 1:1,
  non-recursive — no exponential blow-up — and (b) the real
  billion-laughs vector is DOCTYPE-declared nested custom entities,
  which OOXML never emits (and the depth / size / count guards for
  those remain at their defaults). We also only ever open trusted
  local files.

- **Save As dialog reorganized around presets.** The dialog body
  now reads top-to-bottom: a **Name** section
  (`buildFileNameSection`) → a **Format** section
  (`buildFormatSection`) → a **Save** heading → preset buttons → a
  divider → the **Custom Save** section → a divider → Cancel
  (right-aligned).

  - Three presets — a three-column grid (`.pmd-save-as-presets`),
    each cell (`.pmd-save-as-preset`) a primary (blue) button
    (`.pmd-save-as-preset-btn`) over a caption
    (`.pmd-save-as-preset-sub`) — each call `confirmWith(opts)` with
    a fixed content configuration and save immediately using the
    name + format above: **As-Is**
    `{comments:true, analytics:true, undertags:true}`, **Send Doc**
    `{comments:false, analytics:false, undertags:false}`, **Read
    Doc** `{…false, readMode:true}`.
  - The previous read-mode checkbox (and its mutual-exclusivity
    logic that disabled the other boxes when checked) is removed;
    `readModeBox` is gone. Read-mode export is now reachable only
    via the Save Read Doc preset.
  - The Custom Save section keeps the comments / analytics /
    undertags checkboxes and gains a left-aligned **Save Custom**
    submit button (`.pmd-save-as-custom-save`) directly below them;
    the form's submit handler routes through `confirmWith` with the
    live checkbox state and `readMode:false`.
  - `SaveAsResult` is unchanged, so the save pipeline downstream
    needed no edits — only how the four flags get chosen.
  - Preset filename prefixes: the Send Doc / Read Doc presets pass a
    `SEND_` / `READ_` prefix to `confirmWith(opts, prefix)`, which
    prepends it to the (extension-normalized) file name when the new
    `prefixPresetSaveFilenames` setting is on (default; General tab).
    As-Is and the Save Custom submit pass no prefix. The prefix lands
    in `SaveAsResult.filename` like any other name, so nothing
    downstream special-cases it.
  - Derived exports don't rebind the working doc's identity:
    `runSaveAsFlow` now computes `isFullSave = includeComments &&
    includeAnalytics && includeUndertags && !readMode`. Only a full
    save calls `commitSaveResult` (name/handle/format adopt) +
    `markCurrentDocClean` + `multiDocNotifyFocusedSaved` +
    `clearJournalForActiveDoc`. A content-dropping save (Send/Read
    presets, partial Custom) instead just `recordRecent`s the
    exported file and leaves the working doc's name, dirty flag, and
    journal intact — fixing the bug where the open doc adopted the
    `SEND_`/`READ_` name and the duplicate-open guard then refused to
    reopen the export. The crash-recovery Save-As path
    (`reserializeJournalAs`) was already full-fidelity-only and
    doesn't rebind identity, so it's unaffected.

- **Home / start screen (single-doc mode).** A full-window hub
  shown on launch-with-no-file, on closing the current doc
  (Ctrl+W), and via a new Home button (🏠) at the left of the
  ribbon. Offers New document / New speech document / Open and a
  recently-opened-files list.

  Architecture:
  - `home-screen.ts` — the overlay view. Toggled via the
    `pmd-home-active` class on documentElement, which CSS uses to
    hide the ribbon / nav / editor / status bar and reveal
    `.pmd-home-screen`. The editor stays mounted underneath
    (home is an overlay, not a separate route), so showing /
    hiding is a pure visibility flip. When opened over a live
    doc (Home button) a "Back to document" affordance + Esc
    dismiss it; on launch / close-doc there's a fresh blank
    behind it and no back affordance.
  - `recents-store.ts` — localStorage-backed recent-files list
    (newest first, capped at 12, de-duped by path). Persists
    across restarts; shared across same-session Electron windows.
    Each entry stores the path handle (a string on Electron),
    filename, format, timestamp. Recorded on every in-place
    open and on save (so Save-As of a new doc registers it).
  - New `host:read-file-at-path` IPC (+ preload + electron-host
    wrappers) reads a file at a known path without a picker, for
    the "open recent" flow. Returns null on missing / unreadable
    so the home screen prunes the stale entry.
  - `index.ts` wiring: home actions load IN-PLACE (this window),
    distinct from the ribbon's New/Open which spawn windows.
    `loadFileInPlace`, `pickAndLoadInPlace`, `openRecentInPlace`,
    `createSpeechDocInPlace`, and `mountFreshBlankDoc` share the
    mount + state-reset + recents-record + home-hide steps.
    `initSingleDocBoot` shows home (over the blank starter) when
    it's the first window with no file; recovery + open + the
    spawn-payload path all hide home when they mount real content.
  - Close behavior: the `closeDocOrWindow` command (Ctrl+W) in
    single-doc now routes to `handleCloseDocToHome` — confirm
    unsaved, then mount a fresh blank + show home — instead of
    closing the window. The OS close button (`onCloseRequest`)
    still calls `handleUserCloseRequest` and actually closes, so
    quitting is unaffected; Ctrl+W from home (no doc) also falls
    through to the real close.
  - Web: recents render but `handle` is null (FileSystemFileHandle
    isn't JSON-serializable), so those rows are disabled with a
    tooltip. A future pass could persist handles via IndexedDB.

- **Formatting panel grid columns now share equal width.**
  `.ribbon-formatting-panel` had `grid-template-columns:
  repeat(3, auto)`, which sized each column to its widest
  occupant. With column-major DOM order
  (Pocket-Tag / Hat-Block / Analytic-Undertag), the three
  columns ended up roughly 56px / 49px / 70px wide. When
  style-preview was off (every button has the same 1px gray
  border), the eye picked up the column-width asymmetry as
  inconsistent gaps even though the CSS column-gap was a
  uniform 3px throughout. (Style-preview on hides the
  asymmetry visually by giving Pocket a heavy colored border
  that dominates the eye's reference points.)

  Fix: switch to `repeat(3, 1fr)` — equal-width columns sized
  to the widest occupant's max-content. All buttons now sit at
  the same width, so Pocket → Hat and Hat → Analytic
  center-to-center distances are identical regardless of
  `formattingPanelMode` (labels / shortcuts / both) or
  `formattingPanelPreview`.

- **Ribbon panel column gaps normalized to 3px across the
  board.** An audit found two outliers among the ~10 ribbon
  panels: `.ribbon-color-panel` used `gap: 2px 4px` (claimed
  intentional for split-button readability) and
  `.ribbon-format-menu-panel` used a uniform `gap: 2px`, while
  every other panel used `gap: 2px 3px`. Both are now `gap: 2px
  3px` so adjacent buttons sit at the same visual rhythm
  regardless of which panel they live in. Row gaps were
  already a uniform 2px and are unchanged. The ribbon overflow
  buffer (which measures `column-gap` from a sample panel)
  picks up the new value automatically.

- **Application menu bar restructured + accelerators tracked
  to live keybindings.** `buildMenu()` in `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`
  used to emit a static template with hardcoded `CmdOrCtrl+O`,
  `CmdOrCtrl+S`, etc. The Help menu had three diagnostics-only
  entries; the Window menu was Electron's default `role:
  'windowMenu'`; the View menu's Zoom In / Out / Reset used
  Electron's native `role: 'zoomIn'` etc., which triggered
  Chromium's page-zoom rather than CardMirror's `chromeScale*`
  ribbon commands. The File menu's New Document carried a
  hardcoded `CmdOrCtrl+Alt+N` even though the ribbon command's
  default key is `Mod-n` on Electron.

  Restructure:
  - File → Open, New, Save, Save As, separator, Toggle
    Autosave, separator, Close, Quit (Linux / Windows only).
  - New **Speech** submenu between File and Edit: New Speech
    Document, Mark / Unmark Active as Speech Doc, separator,
    Send to Speech (At Cursor), Send to Speech (At End),
    separator, Select Speech Doc….
  - Edit: explicit submenu instead of `role: 'editMenu'` so we
    can override Redo's accelerator to `CmdOrCtrl+Y` (Electron's
    default is `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+Z`). Both chords still fire
    redo via the renderer's `keymap({ 'Mod-y': redo, 'Mod-Shift-z':
    redo })`.
  - View: reload / forceReload / toggleDevTools kept; the three
    Zoom items now dispatch our `chromeScaleReset / Up / Down`
    ribbon commands with accelerators sourced from the
    renderer-pushed binding map; togglefullscreen kept.
  - Window: removed entirely.
  - Help: Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, separator, Check for
    Updates, Open Crash Dumps Folder, Copy GPU Info.

  Accelerator sync: new `host:set-menu-bindings` IPC. Renderer
  collects `primaryKeyFor(id, ribbonKeyOverrides)` for every
  menu-bound command in a `NATIVE_MENU_COMMANDS` array and pushes
  the map after every settings change (alongside applyBodyFont /
  applyUiFont in applyAll). Main stores the map in a
  `menuBindings: Record<string, string | null>` module variable
  and re-runs `Menu.setApplicationMenu(buildMenu())`. The
  template helper `menuAccelerator(commandId)` converts the
  PM-keymap string ("Mod-o", "Shift-Mod-s", "Ctrl-ArrowLeft")
  to Electron's accelerator form ("CmdOrCtrl+O",
  "Shift+CmdOrCtrl+S", "Ctrl+Left") via the new
  `pmKeyToAccelerator(key)` translator.

  Menu-command routing: the renderer's `onMenuCommand` switch
  in `index.ts` learned a default branch that runs any
  recognized `RibbonCommandId` through `runRibbon(...)`. Means
  the Speech / View / Help / Toggle-Autosave menu items don't
  need bespoke cases — they all flow through the same single
  implementation as ribbon-button clicks and keyboard shortcuts.

- **Select Speech Doc modal.** New
  `src/editor/select-speech-doc-ui.ts` opens a centered overlay
  that lists every open document across every CardMirror
  window. Each row shows the filename (or "Untitled"), the
  owning window's title (or "this window" when in the caller's
  own window), and a "current speech doc" tag with a microphone
  glyph when applicable. Clicking a row that's NOT the current
  speech doc calls `host.speechSet(uid)`; clicking the current
  speech doc clears it (`speechSet(null)`). Both paths close
  the modal. A dedicated "Clear speech doc designation" footer
  button surfaces the unset path more discoverably (greyed out
  when no speech doc is set). Esc and click-outside close.

  Cross-window data path:
  - New `host:doc-info-update(uid, info)` IPC — renderer pushes
    `{ filename }` for a registered uid. Called from
    `updateWindowTitle` (single-doc) and from
    `setFocusedFilename` / `setFocusedFile` plus the
    `registerView` site (multi-pane shell), so the map stays
    fresh as docs mount, save, save-as, rename.
  - New `host:list-docs()` IPC — returns every entry in the
    main-process `docOwners` map, enriched with the cached
    filename, the owning window's id + title, whether it's the
    current speech doc, and convenience flags for "is this the
    caller's own window" / "is its window focused."
  - Existing `host:speech-set` / `speech:changed` infrastructure
    drives the actual designation flip. The modal doesn't
    refocus the picked doc's window — picking is a designation-
    only operation per the user spec.

  Theming: `--pmd-c-speech-bg / -border / -text` tokens drive
  the header and the current-speech-doc row so the gold theming
  stays consistent with the speech banner and other speech-
  flavored UI elements.

  Command wiring: new `selectSpeechDoc` ribbon command (added
  to RibbonCommandId, RIBBON_COMMAND_IDS, RIBBON_COMMAND_LABELS,
  DEFAULT_RIBBON_KEYS with empty default, RibbonContext, and
  the ribbon-groups Speech section). `commandFor` routes it
  through `ctx.selectSpeechDoc()`; `index.ts` binds that to
  `openSelectSpeechDocModal()`.

- **Dropzone shelf — cross-window scratch space for dragged
  content.** Floating bubble pinned to the bottom of every nav
  pane; absorbs any drag from the existing `drag-controller`
  (nav-pane headings, editor surface card/analytic drags) and
  exposes the absorbed items via a click-to-open popover where
  each row is draggable back out into the editor or nav pane.
  Items are shared across every CardMirror window in the same
  session.

  Architecture:
  - **Store** (`src/editor/dropzone-store.ts`) — backend-agnostic
    cross-window state. In Electron, mutations flow through new
    `host:dropzone-{list,add,remove,clear}` IPCs; main holds the
    list in a module variable and broadcasts `dropzone:changed`
    on every change. In web, the store falls back to
    `sessionStorage` (single-window but survives the in-tab
    reload that the multi-pane mode toggle triggers).
  - **Drag-controller extension** (`drag-controller.ts`) —
    `DragItem.prebuilt?: Slice` lets a session carry a slice
    that wasn't sliced from any view's doc; `DragSession.virtual`
    marks the session as having no real source location; new
    `DropTarget.absorb?` callback lets a surface act as a shelf-
    style sink instead of inserting into a view. `commit()`
    routes through `absorb` first when present, falls through to
    the standard cross-view insert path otherwise.
  - **UI** (`src/editor/dropzone-ui.ts`) — one
    `DropzoneController` per nav-pane (so each multi-pane slot
    has its own bubble; they all share state via the store).
    Registers a `DragSurface` whose hitTest returns the bubble's
    bounding rect and whose `absorb` extracts each session
    item's slice (or uses `item.prebuilt` for virtual sessions),
    derives a label, and pushes to the store. The popover's
    rows watch pointerdown + threshold-crossing pointermove to
    start a `virtual` drag session via
    `dragController.begin({...virtual: true})`; the existing
    controller pipeline routes the drop through the normal
    surfaces.
  - **Styling** uses `--pmd-c-drop`, `--pmd-c-drop-outline`,
    `--pmd-c-drop-tint` — the same blue accent the nav drop
    indicator and editor drop indicator use — so the
    accept-state highlight matches the rest of the drag UI.
    Resting state is a muted grey bubble with the
    `--pmd-c-surface-soft` / `--pmd-c-border-soft` tokens to
    blend into the nav-pane chrome.

  Notes:
  - When the nav pane is hidden via `toggleNavPane`, the bubble
    hides with it — accessible again by re-showing the nav.
  - Drag-out always copies (the source isn't a real view
    location), regardless of whether the user holds the
    copy modifier.
  - Drag-out targeting: the virtual `DragItem`'s level is derived from
    the item's stored `type` (`dropzoneDragLevel`: headings via
    `TYPE_TO_LEVEL`; card / analytic_unit at tag level 4; generic content
    anywhere at 4), so the editor / nav surfaces gate drop indicators the
    same way the native drag does — a block lands only at pocket/hat/block
    boundaries, not inside another block. (At the earlier `level: 0` the
    surfaces gated *all* indicators out, so the drag had no target and
    appeared to vanish; a blanket `level: 4` fixed that but wrongly let a
    block drop inside another block.) The shelf's own `hitTest` returns
    null while a `virtual` session is active, so dropping a shelf item
    back onto the shelf is a no-op rather than duplicating it. (Indicators
    are heading-based, so a doc with no headings only offers the doc-end
    target — click-to-insert still covers that case.)
  - No drag-out-to-other-app yet; the controller's surfaces
    only know about nav-pane and editor-surface drops.

- **Ribbon tooltip system unified behind a controller +
  `ribbonTooltipMode` setting.** Previously, ribbon button
  tooltips were a patchwork: the formatting / cite panel buttons
  re-derived their title from `primaryKeyFor` in
  `applyFormattingPanel` (so they tracked rebinds), the autosave
  and plain-paste buttons set their titles imperatively with the
  shortcut hardcoded into the string, and most other ribbon
  buttons had a static `title="..."` in `index.html` that never
  updated. Dropdown menu items (Doc / Card / Table) had no
  tooltips at all.

  New `src/editor/ribbon-tooltips.ts` exports a
  `registerRibbonTooltip({ el, commandId?, label?, kind? })`
  function. The controller stores targets in an array; every
  call to `reapplyAllRibbonTooltips()` walks the array and
  recomputes each title from
  `(settings.ribbonTooltipMode, settings.ribbonKeyOverrides)`.
  Compose rules:

  | mode       | button                        | menu item        |
  | ---------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
  | `none`     | (no title)                    | (no title)       |
  | `tooltip`  | `Label`                       | (no title)       |
  | `shortcut` | `Shortcut` or empty           | `Shortcut` or empty |
  | `both`     | `Label (Shortcut)` or `Label` | `Shortcut` or empty |

  Menu items never repeat their visible menu-row label; only
  the current shortcut shows up on hover (per user spec).

  Wiring: `index.ts` registers every top-level ribbon button by
  id in one block near the end of init, using
  `RIBBON_COMMAND_LABELS` + the command id to derive the label
  by default and an optional explicit label override for state-
  aware buttons (autosave, plain-paste explainer). The
  formatting-panel loop registers its 10 buttons inline.
  `doc-menu-ui.ts` accepts an optional `commandId` field on
  `DocMenuItem` and registers each matching menu button with
  `kind: 'menuItem'`; the close path unregisters them so the
  controller's array doesn't accumulate stale refs across
  many open / close cycles. `applyFormattingPanel` keeps
  ownership of the visible textContent (label vs shortcut vs
  both, driven by `formattingPanelMode`), but no longer sets
  `title` — the controller handles that. Same for the autosave
  and plain-paste state callbacks (they call
  `registerRibbonTooltip` with the updated state-derived
  label).

  Subscriber hookup: `reapplyAllRibbonTooltips()` is called
  from the settings subscriber's `applyAll` so any change to
  `ribbonTooltipMode` or `ribbonKeyOverrides` flows through
  every registered target in one pass.

  Setting metadata: `ribbonTooltipMode` lives at the top of
  Appearance with `kind: 'ribbonTooltipMode'`, a new
  `buildRibbonTooltipModeEditor` in `settings-ui.ts` (a plain
  `<select>` with four options, default `both`), and
  `sanitizeRibbonTooltipMode` in `settings.ts` to validate
  persisted values.

- **UI font is now configurable via Settings → Accessibility →
  "Interface font."** The chrome was previously pinned to
  `'Calibri', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif` in every surface that
  used a font-family override (`body`, plus ~14 redundant
  restatements across `.pmd-settings-dialog`, `.pmd-nav-panel`,
  `.pmd-comments-column`, `.pmd-ai-cite-tooltip`,
  `.pmd-prompt-dialog`, `.pmd-clod-dialog`, `.pmd-recovery-sidebar`,
  `.pmd-save-as-dialog`, `.pmd-reference-dialog`,
  `.pmd-doc-switcher`, `.pmd-timer-panel`, `.pmd-doc-menu`,
  `.pmd-nav-context-menu`, `.pmd-nav-pickup-pill`,
  `#ribbon .formatting-panel-btn`).

  Refactor:
  1. New `--pmd-ui-font` CSS variable on `:root` defaulting to a
     platform system-UI stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont,
     'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif`).
  2. Every Calibri-stack `font-family` declaration in `style.css`
     swapped for `var(--pmd-ui-font)`. The font-color glyph
     (`#fontcolor-glyph`'s `'Calibri', serif`) and the four
     monospace stacks (keybinding chips, delimiter samples, code
     blocks, AI prompt) are left alone — those are intentional
     per-element design choices.
  3. New `uiFont` setting (string; `''` = use the CSS default,
     non-empty = override) added to the `Settings` interface with
     `kind: 'uiFont'` and category `accessibility`.
     `sanitizeUiFont` mirrors `sanitizeBodyFont`'s quote / comma
     stripping but allows empty.
  4. `applyUiFont(font)` in `index.ts`: empty value removes the
     inline override on `documentElement` (CSS default applies);
     non-empty sets `--pmd-ui-font` to `"<font>", sans-serif`
     (quoted unless `font` is one of the generic keywords).
     Mirrors `applyBodyFont`'s shape; called from both the
     settings subscriber and the initial-load pass.
  5. New `buildUiFontEditor` in `settings-ui.ts` reuses
     `FONT_GROUPS` and `isFontAvailable` but prepends a "System
     default" sentinel option that resolves to `''`.

- **Settings dialog tab strip now scrolls behind arrow buttons
  instead of overflowing the dialog.** The previous
  `.pmd-settings-tabs` was a plain flex row with no overflow
  handling — labels just spilled past the dialog's right edge
  when the dialog was narrower than the strip's natural width.

  New shape: wrap the existing `<nav class="pmd-settings-tabs">`
  in a `.pmd-settings-tabs-bar` flex container that also holds
  left and right `.pmd-settings-tabs-scroll` arrow buttons.
  The nav itself is `flex: 1 1 auto; min-width: 0; overflow-x:
  hidden; scroll-behavior: smooth` — no native scrollbar, only
  the JS-driven arrows scroll it. The border-bottom and
  horizontal padding moved from the nav to the bar so the
  active-tab border overlay still works and the arrows sit
  flush against the divider line.

  Arrow visibility is driven by a per-render `ResizeObserver`
  on the nav: when `nav.scrollWidth > nav.clientWidth + 1`,
  both arrows show; otherwise both hide via `[hidden]`. Each
  arrow's `disabled` flag toggles based on `nav.scrollLeft`
  (left at 0, right at end). A scroll-event listener on the
  nav re-runs the same updater so the disabled state stays in
  sync as the user scrolls. Click handler calls `scrollBy(±step,
  smooth)` where step is `max(60, clientWidth * 0.6)` — about
  half the visible width, with a 60px floor so it still
  advances at very narrow widths. Observer is held on the
  modal instance and disconnected in `close()` and on each
  new `render()`.

- **Ribbon resizer reserves a column-gap-sized buffer before the
  overflow trigger fires.** `initRibbonResizer` in `index.ts`
  previously used `scrollWidth > clientWidth + 1` as its overflow
  predicate, hiding a panel only after the ribbon's content had
  literally exceeded its available width. The visible artifact:
  just before the next panel hid, the rightmost panel button
  collided with the right-pinned timer button (no visible gap).

  Naïvely subtracting a buffer from `clientWidth` in that
  predicate doesn't work — `.ribbon-center` is `flex: 1 1 auto`,
  so when the ribbon isn't actually overflowing the center grows
  to fill remaining space and `scrollWidth === clientWidth`. The
  buffered predicate would therefore fire unconditionally and
  hide every panel.

  Instead, measure the actual visual gap: take
  `ribbon-right.left − ribbon-left.right`, subtract any visible
  center-section content (the doc-name chip, when shown), and
  trigger when that remaining free space drops below the buffer.
  The buffer itself is read once at init from a sample panel's
  computed `column-gap` (cite-panel / formatting-panel / color-
  panel — all use 3-4px gaps; fallback 4). The un-hide branch
  uses the same predicate, so the trigger is symmetric — panels
  wait one extra gap of growing room before reappearing,
  preventing flicker right at the threshold.

- **Layer 3 trailing-space trim no longer eats a whitespace-only
  selection.** The `trimRangesForFormatting` in
  `ribbon-commands.ts` used to shave one trailing space from
  every range whose last char was a space, regardless of what
  else was in the range. For an explicitly-selected single space
  (or any whitespace-only run), the shave produced an empty
  range and F9 / F10 / F11 / cite / underline / shading all
  no-op'd silently — there was no way to format a deliberately-
  selected trailing space.

  New rule (the spec calls it Rule 3): trim the trailing space
  iff `[from, to - 1]` contains at least one non-space text
  character. Monotonic — when there's word content, exactly one
  trailing space is always shaved; when the range is whitespace
  only, nothing is shaved. New `hasNonSpaceChar(doc, from, to)`
  helper walks text leaves between the positions and short-
  circuits on the first non-space char (per `classifyChar` from
  `word-break.ts`). Considered Rule 2 ("trim iff the char at
  `to - 2` isn't a space"), which lets the user deliberately
  format multi-trailing-space tails after a word — rejected for
  the surprising toggle (adding one more trailing space to your
  selection flips whether the others get formatted). Rule 3 is
  predictable; the rare multi-trailing-space case can be worked
  around by selecting one char past the spaces or by selecting
  just the spaces.

- **AI cite creator now guarantees the cite stands alone in its
  own paragraph.** Refactor of `applyCiteToSelection` in
  `ai/cite-creator.ts` into a (testable) `buildCiteTransaction`
  helper. The existing pipeline still runs first — `tr.insertText`
  to replace the selection, `tr.removeMark` to strip inherited
  boundary marks, per-token `tr.addMark` to apply `cite_mark` to
  the leading "Lastname Date" pieces. After that, two new
  defensive splits: if the surrounding textblock has inline
  content AFTER the cite end (the common bug case — selection
  spanned a paragraph break and the trailing text from the last
  selected paragraph is now joined onto the cite), `tr.split(end)`
  to break out the tail. Symmetric `tr.split(start)` when there's
  pre-cite content in the same textblock. The after-split runs
  first so the start position doesn't need remapping. Both
  wrapped in try/catch — schema-illegal splits (e.g., a second
  tag inside one card) fall back to the inline-cite shape rather
  than crashing. `applyCiteToSelection` now just calls the
  builder and dispatches.

- **Highlight Acronym (Alt+F11) added; Emphasize Acronym
  rebound from Ctrl+F10 to Alt+F10.** New
  `highlightAcronym(activeColor)` in `ribbon-commands.ts`
  mirrors `emphasizeAcronym`'s per-word-first-letter walk: for
  each textblock the selection touches, build a word-class map
  (`isWordChar` from `word-break.ts`), expand the selection
  range to whole-word boundaries, then emit the start position
  of each word inside that expanded range. The selection-expand
  rule and word definition are identical to Emphasize Acronym
  (so `U.S.A.` is three words per the spec, and the command
  marks `U`, `S`, `A` individually).

  Two deliberate deviations from Emphasize Acronym, parallel to
  the differences between `applyHighlight` and `applyEmphasis`:
  (1) no `NAMED_STYLE_SKIP_BLOCKS` gate — highlight is allowed
  in structural textblocks (tags, analytics, pockets, hat,
  block, undertag), matching the F11 toggle's reach; (2) no
  `stripDirectFormattingOnApply` — highlight is additive and
  shouldn't change the marked character's other formatting. The
  apply uses `tr.removeMark(...highlight) + tr.addMark(...
  highlight.create({color}))` per first-letter slot so a new
  active color wins over any existing highlight on those slots
  (parallel to `applyHighlight`'s apply-branch behavior).

  Bindings: `Mod-F10` → `Alt-F10` for Emphasize Acronym, plus
  new `Alt-F11` → Highlight Acronym in `DEFAULT_RIBBON_KEYS`.
  Both stay rebindable via Settings → Keybindings. The Ctrl-F10
  rebinding choice keeps Mod-F10 (which on Win/Linux is
  Ctrl-F10) available for future use; symmetric to Mod-F11
  (Ctrl-F11, Apply Shading) and F11 (Apply Highlight) already
  occupying the highlight column. `ribbon-groups.ts` lists
  Highlight Acronym next to Apply Highlight in the Character
  Styles group so the settings UI surfaces it near its
  conceptual sibling.

- **Viewport-rockets-to-doc-end on paste / F7 fixed by
  changing the absorb-plugin from a wholesale doc replace to
  per-region surgical edits.** Two community reports surfaced
  the same underlying bug: (1) Cumdog: pasting multi-line text
  with an F7-styled tag somewhere above sends the cursor to the
  very end of the doc; (2) Buntin: pressing F7 on a paragraph
  that has any doc-level paragraphs below it does the same.
  Both reduce to the same root cause — the card-body
  absorption rule (an `appendTransaction` plugin that absorbs
  doc-level paragraphs / cite_paragraphs / undertags after a
  card or analytic_unit) was doing the rewrite in a single
  `tr.replaceWith(0, doc.content.size, rebuilt)`. PM's default
  selection mapping treats the deleted range as fully replaced
  and pushes the cursor (with association-right) to the END of
  the inserted content, which for the absorb tr is the end of
  the last absorbed orphan-now-card-body.

  The new shape: walk the doc to find each contiguous
  absorption region (a `card` / `analytic_unit` followed by
  one or more absorbable doc-level siblings), then for each
  region, in a single transaction, perform two surgical steps
  right-to-left so position arithmetic stays valid: (a)
  `tr.insert(cardContentEnd, absorbedBodiesFragment)` to put
  the new bodies inside the card just before its closing
  boundary, and (b) `tr.delete(orphansStart + insertedSize,
  orphansEnd + insertedSize)` to remove the originals from doc
  level. The cursor (typically NOT inside the moved orphans —
  it's in the absorbing card's tag, or somewhere unrelated)
  stays exactly where it was. The existing
  `absorbedDocChildren` helper is retained for tests that
  probe absorb behavior directly. New `findAbsorbRegions`
  function returns the per-region `{ absorbingPos,
  absorbingNodeSize, orphansStart, orphansEnd, bodiesContent }`
  shape that the new appendTransaction consumes.

- **Phantom-empty-tag card on multi-paragraph paste fixed by
  pre-fitting the slice in the paste handler.** Pasting two or
  more paragraphs into a `card_body` that has sibling
  `card_body`s used to bubble PM's slice fit up to the card
  level: the original card split into two cards with the
  second one carrying an empty `tag` and the original
  trailing card_bodies absorbed into it. Root cause: PM's
  `replace`-with-slice fitting can't insert a multi-paragraph
  slice into a `card_body` (whose content rule is `inline*`)
  without splitting, so it lifts the split up until the slice
  fits as siblings — which at the card level requires opening
  a new card, which requires a tag (= empty placeholder tag).

  New `tryPasteAsCardBodies(state, slice)` in
  `paste-plugin.ts` runs after the existing head-detection
  branch in `handlePaste`. When the slice is 2+ top-level
  paragraphs and the cursor's parent is a `card_body` inside
  a `card` or `analytic_unit`, it converts each paragraph into
  a `card_body` of the same content (preserving inline marks)
  and dispatches the replace with the new slice. The cursor's
  containing card now naturally accepts multiple `card_body`s
  as siblings, so the split stays inside the card.
  `openStart` / `openEnd` carry through from the original
  slice so the first body still joins inline with the
  pre-cursor text and the last body still joins inline with
  the post-cursor text — same UX as a single-paragraph paste,
  just with the multi-line break preserved at the card_body
  boundary. Falls through to PM's default for single-paragraph
  slices, slices with non-paragraph top-level children
  (carries / wholesale-card pastes go through the existing
  head-detection branch), and cursors outside the card_body
  context.

- **Copy Last Cite at offset 0 of a paragraph now inserts the
  cite BEFORE that paragraph instead of after.** Community
  report (Cumdog): in a multi-paragraph card with a tag but no
  cite, putting the cursor at the start of the card and
  pressing the Copy Last Cite hotkey lands the cite at the
  start of the SECOND body, not between the tag and the first
  body. Cursor at the END of the tag worked correctly. Root
  cause was in `computeCitePasteLocation` in
  `ribbon-commands.ts`: outside the empty-paragraph branch the
  code always returned `$from.after(paraDepth)` — the position
  AFTER the cursor's containing paragraph. For a cursor at
  offset 0 of the first body, "after the first body" is
  visually where the second body begins, which is where the
  cite ended up.

  Added a new branch: when the cursor sits at `parentOffset
  === 0` of a `REPLACE_IF_EMPTY` paragraph (`card_body`,
  `cite_paragraph`, `undertag`, `paragraph`) that has content,
  return `$from.before(paraDepth)` — the position BEFORE the
  paragraph — so the cite lands at the visual cursor position
  (above that paragraph in the parent's child list). Cursor
  mid-paragraph and end-of-paragraph still fall through to the
  existing `$from.after(paraDepth)` branch. The empty-paragraph
  branch (replace-the-paragraph-with-the-cite) is unchanged
  and still runs first.

- **Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down with an active selection no longer
  carries the caret into the adjacent paragraph.** The plain
  (no-Shift) variants now collapse the selection by snapping to
  the start (Up) or end (Down) of the paragraph that contains
  the corresponding selection edge (`$from` for Up, `$to` for
  Down), instead of computing the destination from
  `selection.$head`. Previously, with a selection where the
  head was at the bottom edge, Ctrl+Down ran
  `destNextParaStart` and moved to the NEXT paragraph's start;
  symmetric for Ctrl+Up with head at the top edge running
  `destPrevParaStart`. New `verticalCommandPair` in
  `word-selection-keymap.ts` mirrors the existing
  `horizontalCommandPair` (which handled the Ctrl+Left/Right
  collapse case): when `selection.empty` is false and Shift is
  not held, the move command snaps to the paragraph edge of
  the relevant selection corner and stops. Shift-extend
  variants (`Ctrl-Shift-ArrowUp / -ArrowDown`) keep the
  existing extend semantics by passing through to the base
  command pair.

  Down-side asymmetry: after `Ctrl-Shift-ArrowDown`,
  `selection.$to` lands at `parentOffset === 0` of the
  paragraph BELOW the last visually-selected paragraph
  (`destNextParaStart` walks to the next paragraph's START,
  not the current one's end). A naïve `$to.end()` snap there
  would carry the cursor to the end of a paragraph the user
  never saw as part of the selection. When the down-side
  corner is at `parentOffset === 0`, the fix falls back to
  `prevTextblock(doc, corner.start()).end` — the end of the
  last *visibly* selected paragraph. The symmetric Up case
  doesn't arise via `Ctrl-Shift-ArrowUp` because
  `destPrevParaStart` lands inside the upper textblock (at its
  content-start, not past it), so `selection.$from` is always
  inside the visual selection.

- **Ctrl+Left / Ctrl+Right with a selection now snap to the
  word edge of the corner, not just collapse.** Refines the
  earlier "collapse to selection.from / .to" behavior of
  `horizontalCommandPair` so it matches `verticalCommandPair`'s
  paragraph-edge snap, one notch finer. With a non-empty
  selection and Shift NOT held: take the corner (`$from` for
  Ctrl+Left, `$to` for Ctrl+Right); if the corner is INSIDE a
  word/punct run (left and right flanking chars are the same
  word/punct class), snap to that run's edge via the same
  `prevUnitStart` / `nextUnitStart` iterator the no-selection
  variants use (including the spec's trailing-space absorption
  on the right side); otherwise collapse to the corner. The
  "otherwise" branch is the analog of `verticalCommandPair`'s
  `$to.parentOffset === 0` fallback — when the corner already
  sits at a unit boundary (textblock edge, adjacent to
  space/tab, or at a word↔punct transition), end-of-prev-unit
  and start-of-next-unit are the same position, so the snap is
  a no-op and we just collapse.

  Concrete: select "The" inside "Therefore" → Ctrl+Right lands
  the cursor at the end of "Therefore" (with trailing-space
  absorption if the word has one). After a Ctrl+Shift+Right
  that absorbed past a word's trailing space (head at start of
  the next word), plain Ctrl+Right just collapses there — does
  NOT push further into the next word, matching the analogous
  Ctrl+Shift+Down → Ctrl+Down behavior. Helper
  `isInsideWordOrPunctUnit(map, offset)` does the boundary
  check.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4 — 2026-05-22

- **Layer 2 (keyboard navigation keymap) from the Word-selection
  spec.** New `src/editor/word-selection-keymap.ts` adds bindings
  that override the browser's regex-style word iteration:

  - `Ctrl-ArrowLeft / Ctrl-ArrowRight` (`Alt-` variants for Mac)
    → start of previous / next unit. Walks the textblock's
    per-position class map using `classifyChar` from
    `word-break.ts`, so `don't` is one unit, `U.S.A.` is three.
    Cross-textblock: at offset 0 jumps to the start of the
    previous textblock's LAST unit; at offset == content.size
    jumps to the next textblock's first unit start.
  - `Ctrl-ArrowUp / Ctrl-ArrowDown` (`Alt-` variants on Mac) →
    start of current / next paragraph. Asymmetric: Ctrl+Up has
    an intermediate stop at the current paragraph's start
    (matching Word); Ctrl+Down skips straight to the next
    paragraph with no equivalent stop at the current
    paragraph's end.
  - `PageUp / PageDown` → previous / next heading marker. Same
    shape as Ctrl+Up/Down but using `collectHeadings`'s set
    (pocket / hat / block / tag / analytic from
    `headings.ts:TYPE_TO_LEVEL`). PageUp is asymmetric the same
    way Ctrl+Up is — first stop at the current heading's
    start, then the previous heading on a subsequent press.
  - `Shift-` variants of every move command extend the
    selection (anchor pinned, head moves) so the keymap
    naturally pairs with the mouse state machine.

  The keymap sits ABOVE `baseKeymap` in the plugin list so its
  Ctrl+Arrow / PageUp/Down bindings take precedence. `Home`,
  `End`, `Ctrl+Home`, `Ctrl+End` are deliberately left on the
  browser default — visual-line and doc start/end already match
  the spec.

- **Layer 2 (mouse-selection state machine) from the Word-
  selection spec.** New `src/editor/word-selection-plugin.ts`
  implements the click + drag + shift+click contract:

  - **Single click.** Anchor = a point (the click position).
    Granularity = character, dynamic. Dragging within the
    click's enclosing unit (W0) keeps character granularity
    and the selection is exactly `point..activeEnd`. Dragging
    PAST W0's boundary upgrades to word granularity and pulls
    the rest of W0 into the selection (anchor unit becomes W0
    in full); subsequent extension proceeds by full units.
    Reversing back inside W0 downgrades to character granularity
    and snaps back to `point..activeEnd`.
  - **Double click.** Anchor = the Layer 1 query unit (with
    trailing-space absorption). Granularity = word, fixed.
    Drag extends by bare units (only the initiating click
    absorbs trailing space; subsequent units do NOT). The
    anchor unit stays fully selected even when the drag
    reverses direction.
  - **Shift+click.** Same operation as drag: moves the active
    end under the current anchor + granularity. After a
    double-click, shift+click extends by word. After a single
    click, follows the dynamic single-click rule. Shift+
    double-click and shift+triple-click are no-ops per spec.
  - **Triple click.** Anchor = the containing textblock range,
    granularity = paragraph (fixed). Drag extends one whole
    paragraph at a time; the anchor paragraph stays fully
    selected when the drag reverses. Shift+click after a
    triple-click extends paragraph-by-paragraph — same
    mechanism as the drag.

  The earlier `triple-click-drag-plugin.ts` has been removed —
  its drag-extension logic is folded into the unified state
  machine, and dispatches now carry the
  `pmd:word-selection-plugin` meta so the `apply` hook doesn't
  treat them as external selection changes (which would have
  invalidated the freshly-set paragraph anchor before the next
  shift+click could read it).

  The plugin tracks a module-level `currentAnchor` so shift+
  click after a gesture remembers granularity. An external
  selection-changing transaction (typing, arrow keys,
  programmatic dispatch) marks the anchor stale via a
  `selectionSet`-watching `apply` hook; the next shift+click
  rebuilds a fresh point anchor from PM's
  `selection.anchor`. Dispatches set a
  `pmd:word-selection-plugin` meta on each transaction so we
  can tell ours apart from external ones.

  Atom inline-nodes (images) skip the plugin so PM's default
  NodeSelection still fires on image clicks. `event.preventDefault()`
  on mousedown blocks the browser's default focus transfer in
  the no-op-selection case (single-click at an existing caret
  spot); `view.focus()` is called explicitly to compensate.

- **Layer 1 (word-break iterator) + Layer 3 (formatting trim)
  from the Word-selection spec.** Spec lives at
  `~/Downloads/word-selection-behavior.md`; this commit lands
  the first two of three layers (Layer 2 — custom mouse +
  keyboard selection gestures — comes later).

  New `src/editor/word-break.ts` is the single source of truth
  for what counts as a word. Three-class scheme: word-character
  (letters, digits, `'` U+0027, `'` U+2019), space (U+0020 +
  Unicode whitespace, excluding tab), tab (atomic, never
  groups), punctuation (everything else, including `'` U+2018,
  `_`, `-`, em / en dashes, `.`, `,`, `:`, `;`, `…`). Four base
  units (word, punctuation, space, tab) with asymmetric
  trailing-space absorption: querying a word OR punctuation
  unit extends to include any immediately-following space unit,
  but querying a space unit does NOT reach backward. Tab never
  absorbs. Implementation uses Unicode-aware character classes
  (`\p{L}\p{N}`) so non-ASCII letters and digits are word
  characters; surrogate pairs fall through whichever class
  their first code unit suggests.

  Both pre-existing word-iterators have been replaced:
  `wordRangeAtCursor` in `ribbon-commands.ts` (used by the F7
  Emphasis, F8 Cite, F10 Emphasize Acronym word-expansion
  fallback) and `isWordChar` in `find-replace-plugin.ts` (used
  by the whole-word Find toggle) both call into the new
  iterator. Behavioral consequences: whole-word Find treats `_`
  as a boundary now (`\w`-style regex matched it as a word
  char), F10 Emphasize Acronym on "U.S.C.P." emphasizes
  U / S / C / P instead of just the leading U, and so on.

  Layer 3 lands as a `trimRangesForFormatting(doc, ranges)`
  helper in `ribbon-commands.ts` and a
  `getOperatingRangesForFormatting(state)` wrapper around the
  similar-selection-plugin's `getOperatingRanges` — every
  formatting command's call-site swapped to the wrapper.
  Commands that bypass `getOperatingRanges` (the non-shadow
  branches in `adjustFontSize` / `setFontSize` / `runUniColor`
  / `highlightToShading` / `shadingToHighlight` / strip-mark in
  `color-panel.ts`) trim inline against `sel.from / sel.to`.
  `shadowAwareToggleMark` was previously falling through to
  PM's `toggleMark` on the non-shadow path; it now unifies
  through the trimmed-ranges path so the keyboard Ctrl+B /
  Ctrl+I / Ctrl+U bindings get the trim too.

- **Duplicate-open guard on the file-open path.** The workspace
  doesn't currently support having multiple copies of the same
  doc open — opening a duplicate would create a second
  `DocRecord` with its own undo history, journal, and dirty
  state, which is a confusing UX. The two entry points now
  check before loading:

  - Single-pane (`runOpenFlow`): compares `opened.handle`
    against `currentDocHandle`.
  - Multi-pane shell (`onFileOpen` ribbon path +
    `openFileIntoSlot` per-slot button): a new
    `findOpenRecordByHandle` walks every slot's stack. On
    match, the existing copy is brought to its slot's visible
    record and the slot is focused, so the user lands on the
    doc they "tried to open."

  Handle equality goes through a new
  `isSameOpenHandle(a, b)` helper in `host/index.ts` — string
  comparison on Electron paths, `FileSystemFileHandle
  .isSameEntry()` on the browser. Never-saved docs (handle
  null) aren't deduped — we have no identity to compare yet.

  Cross-window duplicates are also covered on Electron via a
  main-process path map (`Map<canonical-path, windowId>`).
  Three new IPC handlers in `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`:

  - `host:open-path-check(path)` is the read-only pre-load
    probe. If another window owns the path, main focuses that
    window (restoring it if minimized) and returns
    `{ takenByOther: true }` so the caller can toast + abort.
  - `host:open-path-register(path)` claims a path for the
    caller window once a doc has finished mounting.
  - `host:open-path-release(path)` drops the claim on
    unmount / Save-As to a new path.

  Window-close auto-cleanup runs in the existing `browser-
  window-created → closed` listener so a force-quit can't
  leave stale entries blocking re-opens. The `host:spawn-
  window` handler also claims the new window's path
  atomically at spawn time so a concurrent open from a third
  window can't sneak in between spawn and the new window's
  mount. Renderers wire through a centralized
  `setCurrentDocHandle` helper (single-pane) /
  `syncDocPathClaim` helper (multi-pane shell) — each is
  called at every handle-assignment site (open, recovery,
  spawn-target initial mount, Save-As, close) so the
  registration map stays in sync. Browser host has no
  multi-window concept and no-ops these methods.

- **Comments column ported to multi-pane as a shell-row
  sibling.** Previously the column was hidden whenever
  `multiDocWorkspace` was on and the Add Comment / Ask AI ribbon
  commands refused to run. The shell now adopts the shared
  `#comments-column` as a sibling of `.pmd-multi-row` —
  `.pmd-multi-shell` is `flex-direction: row` so the multi-row
  takes `flex: 1` and the column takes its persisted width via
  `--pmd-comments-width`. Visually it reads as a narrow fourth
  slot that shrinks the three doc panes equally instead of
  cutting into the focused pane only.

  Threads follow focus: `focusSlot` calls
  `commentsColumn.render()` so cards rebuild against the newly
  active view (the column's `getView` already returns
  `setActiveView`'s tracked view). Because the column lives
  outside every pane's scroll container, scrolling the focused
  doc would otherwise leave cards stranded at the wrong Y —
  `attachFocusedScrollSync` installs a rAF-throttled scroll
  listener on the focused `.pmd-pane-body` that calls
  `CommentsColumn.relayoutCards()`. The listener tears down and
  re-installs on every focus change; `handleSlotEmptied`
  detaches it when the last doc closes.

  Per-record `dispatchTransaction` now calls
  `notifyCommentsForActiveTransaction` (a new helper exported
  from `editor/index.ts`); it short-circuits unless the
  transaction belongs to the active view, so background-stack
  edits in non-focused panes don't paint over the focused doc's
  column. `buildDocRecord` now accepts an optional `threads`
  array and dispatches `loadThreads` after `record` is
  initialized (a `dispatchTransaction` closing over `record`
  meant earlier dispatch placement hit a TDZ);
  `loadOpenedIntoSlot` (docx + cmir) and `onRecoveredDoc` pass
  threads through so docs land in multi-pane with their
  comments already in plugin state.

  Layout-pinning cleanups carried over from the single-pane
  fix: `desiredTop` no longer clamps at 0 — a heading scrolled
  above the editor's top gives a negative diff in multi-pane
  (column is decoupled from the scroll container), and cards
  should slide off the top symmetrically with the bottom rather
  than pile against `top: 0`. `actualTop` packing math
  similarly allows negative values. Single-pane is unaffected
  because column and editor share a scroll container — the
  diff stays positive in that mode.

- **AI-comment identification moved from `kind: 'ai'` to a
  round-trip-safe shape: fixed `'AI'` initials + a `(AI)` suffix
  on the author name.** The `kind` field doesn't survive a docx
  round-trip — Word has no concept of AI vs human, so when a doc
  is saved as docx and re-imported, every comment comes back as
  `kind: 'human'`. AI comments lost their purple-badge styling
  in the process. New AI comments now carry the AI marker in
  fields that DO round-trip: `initials: 'AI'` (regardless of
  persona) and an author name like `Clod (AI)` (or just `'AI'`
  when no custom persona is set — no double-suffix). A new
  `isAiComment(comment)` helper recognizes either signal and
  drives the existing `.pmd-comment-ai` purple styling path.
  The helper also honors legacy `kind: 'ai'` so comments saved
  before this change keep their styling. New AI comments are
  written with `kind: 'human'`. The small inline "AI" tag that
  used to sit next to the author name has been removed —
  redundant with the `(AI)` suffix that's now baked into the
  name. CSS class `.pmd-comment-kind-tag` deleted.

- **Multi-pane workspace shortcuts moved into the ribbon
  registry; all rebindable via Settings → Keybindings.** Eight
  new `RibbonCommandId`s with defaults matching what shipped
  earlier in this Unreleased cycle:

  - `focusSlot1` / `focusSlot2` / `focusSlot3` → `Mod-1/2/3`
  - `sendDocToSlot1` / `sendDocToSlot2` / `sendDocToSlot3` →
    `Mod-Shift-1/2/3`
  - `toggleSlotExpand` → `Mod-Shift-f`
  - `closeDocOrWindow` → `Mod-w`

  Each gets a label, default-key entry, group placement (new
  "Multi-pane workspace" section in `ribbon-groups.ts`), a
  no-op `Command` case in `commandFor` (the keymap matcher
  doesn't need to do anything — these are view-less actions),
  and an entry in `VIEWLESS_RIBBON_COMMANDS`. The global
  window keydown handler in `editor/index.ts` dispatches them
  via `runViewlessRibbon`, which now calls into a small new
  `runMultiPane` helper that dynamic-imports the shell module
  and invokes one of three new exports:

  - `focusSlotByIndex(idx)`
  - `sendVisibleToSlotByIndex(idx)`
  - `toggleFocusedSlotExpand()`

  These are thin wrappers around new `MultiPaneShell` methods
  (`focusSlotByIndex`, `sendVisibleToSlotByIndex`,
  `toggleFocusedSlotExpand`). `closeDocOrWindow` uses the
  existing `tryCloseVisibleInFocusedSlot` + fallback to
  `handleUserCloseRequest`.

  Two standalone `window` keydown listeners removed
  (`onSlotShortcutKey` and `onExpandToggleKey`) — the work
  flows through the global ribbon-keymap path now. The
  Electron menu's `CmdOrCtrl+W` accelerator stays hardcoded
  as a discoverability cue; if the user rebinds
  `closeDocOrWindow`, both paths fire the same action.

  Ribbon keymap matcher (`ribbonKeyStringFor`) now normalizes
  digit keys via `e.code` (e.g., `Digit1` → `1`) so
  `Mod-Shift-1` matches even though Shift+1 produces
  `e.key === '!'` on US keyboards (and layout-specific shifted
  digits elsewhere). Without the fix, the new `sendDocToSlotN`
  bindings wouldn't fire from the global handler. Letters and
  symbol keys still use `e.key`.

  The Ctrl+Tab doc-cycling overlay is the lone exception —
  its hold-and-press semantics (modifier held, Tab pressed
  repeatedly, modifier released to commit) don't fit the
  discrete-press ribbon-command model. The
  `onDocCycleKey` / `onDocCycleKeyUp` listeners stay on
  `window` with hardcoded `Tab` matching.

- **Multi-pane: Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab cycle docs within the
  focused slot.** New `Slot.cycleVisible(delta)` advances the
  visible doc index in a slot's stack with wrap-around. Wired
  via a new `onDocCycleKey` window keydown listener (mounted
  alongside the existing `onSlotShortcutKey` for Mod-N slot
  focus). Routes through the existing `showRecord` so the
  shared-chrome / focusSlot dance fires the same way as a
  click on the stack-dropdown menu would.

  Desktop (Electron) accepts plain Mod+Tab — Electron windows
  have no native tabs to cycle, so the keydown passes through
  to the renderer's JS unmodified. Web reserves the plain
  Mod+Tab chord for the browser's own tab cycling, so the
  renderer never sees the keydown there. The handler also
  accepts Mod+Alt+Tab as the web-edition fallback (and on
  desktop, which makes Mod+Alt+Tab a universal alias).
  Shift toggles direction.

- **Multi-pane: Ctrl+Shift+1 / 2 / 3 send the focused slot's
  visible doc to slot N.** Mirror of the Mod-N slot-focus
  chord. New `Slot.releaseVisible()` is closeVisible without
  the view destroy / journal drop: detaches the visible
  record's DOM, removes it from the stack, mounts the next
  visible doc (or empties the slot), and returns the released
  `DocRecord` so the shell can re-push it into the target
  slot's stack. The view stays live across the move, so the
  doc keeps its cursor, selection, undo history, autosave
  state, and any other view-attached state.

  Extended `onSlotShortcutKey` to differentiate the Mod-only
  chord (focus) from the Mod-Shift chord (send-to). The
  digit-match uses `e.code === 'Digit1'/'Digit2'/'Digit3'`
  rather than `e.key === '1'/'2'/'3'` because Shift-modified
  digits render as `!`/`@`/`#` (or layout-specific characters)
  in `e.key`; `e.code` is the physical-key identifier and
  works for both shifted and unshifted chords.

  Expand-mode edges handled via the existing notification
  callbacks: source emptying in expand mode drops expand
  mode; target receiving a doc while a different slot is
  expanded keeps the doc hidden until expand mode exits.

- **Exported .docx is Verbatim-recognized on open.** Verbatim's
  per-doc ribbon-visibility callback
  (`Ribbon.GetRibbonVisibility`, registered on every `<group>`
  in Debate.dotm's `customUI14.xml`) decides activation by
  reading `ActiveDocument.AttachedTemplate.Name`. To make our
  exports activate the Debate ribbon without the user clicking
  Verbatimize first, `Docx.empty()` in `src/ooxml/docx.ts` now
  emits:

  - `word/settings.xml` containing
    `<w:attachedTemplate r:id="rId1"/>`.
  - `word/_rels/settings.xml.rels` containing the rel with
    `Type=".../attachedTemplate"`,
    `Target="file:///Debate.dotm"`,
    `TargetMode="External"`.
  - The matching `<Override>` for the settings part in
    `[Content_Types].xml`.
  - A `<Relationship>` linking `document.xml` →
    `settings.xml` in `word/_rels/document.xml.rels` (added in
    `exporter.ts`'s `buildRelsXml`, claiming `rId2`; dynamic
    rels now start at `rId3`).

  Methodology: extracted Debate.dotm and the VBA strings dump
  pointed at `AttachedTemplate` + `InstallCheckTemplateName` as
  the recognition predicate. First experiment (the docVar
  hypothesis — setting `VerbatimVersion` in `<w:docVars>` to
  various values) was falsified — none of v2 / v3 / v4 / v5
  activated the ribbon. Second experiment
  (`<w:attachedTemplate>` with the rel in `document.xml.rels`)
  also failed; the diff against a doc that the Verbatimize
  macro itself produced showed the rel belongs in
  `settings.xml.rels`, not `document.xml.rels`. Third
  experiment landed it:

  - v8 (`Target="Debate.dotm"`, bare filename): failed.
  - v9 (full Windows path the Verbatimize macro wrote on the
    author's machine): worked on two different Windows
    installs, even though the path was hardcoded to the
    original user's folder — confirming Word doesn't validate
    the stored path file-system-exists, just reads the
    basename of the URI.
  - v10 / v11 / v12 (URI shapes with no / fake-Unix /
    fake-Windows path components): all three worked on
    Windows. v10 / v11 also worked on Mac Verbatim (a separate
    Mac Word notification-daemon hang was diagnosed via the
    crash report's call stack and confirmed unrelated).

  Picked v10 (`file:///Debate.dotm`) as the shippable Target —
  shortest URI that activates recognition; Word doesn't care
  whether the path is reachable.

  Round-trip safety: today's exporter doesn't preserve the
  input docx's `word/settings.xml`; `toDocx` always starts
  from `Docx.empty()`. So no merge logic is needed — every
  export ships with the recognition surface, whether the
  source was fresh or imported. Users who don't have Verbatim
  installed see no impact: the stored attached-template
  Target is unresolvable to them, Word falls back to
  Normal.dotm, no prompt, no UI shift.

  The experiment script
  (`reference-docs/experiment-verbatimize.mjs`, gitignored)
  stays around as a local diagnostic if Verbatim's
  recognition mechanism ever shifts in a future release.

- **Emphasize Acronym (Mod-F10).** New ribbon command for
  marking the source letters of an acronym. Algorithm:
  1. Bail if the selection is empty.
  2. For each textblock that overlaps the selection (skipping
     structural blocks via the existing `NAMED_STYLE_SKIP_BLOCKS`
     set — emphasis_mark is body-only), find the leftmost and
     rightmost non-whitespace character indices within the
     selection's clip range. If neither exists (selection is
     entirely whitespace), skip the block.
  3. Expand leftward and rightward through non-whitespace to
     reach whole-word boundaries (same word definition as
     `wordRangeAtCursor` — maximal run of non-whitespace within
     the textblock, inline leaves break words, mark boundaries
     don't).
  4. Walk the expanded range and emit a 1-character mark range
     for every word-start position (WS-to-non-WS transitions
     plus the initial position if non-WS).
  5. Apply `emphasis_mark` to each range plus the same direct-
     formatting strip `applyEmphasis` uses.

  Wired the standard ribbon-command surface — type union,
  registry array, label ("Emphasize Acronym"), default key
  (`Mod-F10` → "Ctrl+F10" on Win/Linux, "⌘F10" on Mac),
  dispatcher case, and `ribbon-groups.ts` placement next to
  `applyEmphasis` in the Character styles group so both the
  cheat sheet and the keybindings editor inherit the
  grouping.

- **Keybindings editor grouped by thematic section.** Lifted
  the `GROUPS` taxonomy out of `reference-ui.ts` into a new
  shared `ribbon-groups.ts` module as `RIBBON_GROUPS`. The
  drift-guard assertion (every `RibbonCommandId` lands in
  exactly one group, no duplicates, no orphans) moved with it
  and now protects BOTH surfaces — adding a new command
  without categorizing it throws at module load.

  Settings → Keybindings used to call
  `[...RIBBON_COMMAND_IDS].sort((a, b) => labelA.localeCompare(labelB))`
  and render every row in one alphabetical flat list (~70
  rows). Now iterates `RIBBON_GROUPS` instead: each group
  becomes a `<section>` with an uppercase muted `<h3>` heading
  + that group's commands in the order the group defines them
  (matching the cheat sheet's ergonomic clustering, not raw
  alphabetical). Group headings are `position: sticky; top:
  0` inside the scrollable list so users keep their place as
  they scroll through long sections like "Table" (10 rows).

  Single source of truth: editing `ribbon-groups.ts` updates
  both the cheat sheet and the rebinding editor. No more
  "remembered to update both" failure mode for future
  command additions.

- **Round-trip: hyperlink rel Targets are XML-attribute-escaped.**
  `exporter.ts`'s `buildRelsXml` was interpolating `rel.target`
  raw into the `Target="..."` attribute of each hyperlink
  `<Relationship>`. URLs containing `&` (the standard
  query-string parameter separator — extremely common in cite
  links) ended up as raw `&` in the XML, which is malformed.
  Word's loader uses a recovery-mode parser that pulls the
  document body through anyway, but flags the file as
  corrupted on open. User-reported symptom: round-trip of a
  doc with many cite hyperlinks opened on another machine as
  "we found a problem with some content" and images failed to
  display (likely because the rels XML failure cascaded into
  the relationship resolver giving up partway).

  Fix: pipe `rel.target` through the existing `escAttr` helper
  (`src/ooxml/xml.ts`) for both the hyperlink and image rel
  emission paths. `escAttr` escapes `&`, `<`, `>`, and `"` —
  the four chars that can break an attribute value. Image
  Targets are internally generated and currently safe, but
  symmetry / defense in depth justifies the escape there too
  (a future media filename with a special char would have the
  same problem).

  Detected via diff of a doc round-tripped through CardMirror
  against the same doc untouched: both opened in Word, but the
  round-tripped one reported corrupted on open. `xmllint
  --noout document.xml.rels` returned `EntityRef: expecting
  ';'` errors at exactly the unescaped `&` positions.

- **Plain-paste no longer splits cards on a trailing newline.**
  Long-standing user-reported bug ("skipping around on paste"
  / "viewport shoots to the bottom") had a narrow trigger:
  copy-and-plain-paste of text containing a line break into a
  tag (or other single-line block). A common real-world
  occurrence is triple-clicking an article title in the
  browser; most browsers grab a trailing `\n` alongside the
  visible text.

  `buildPlainTextSlice("Article Title\n")` produced a
  two-paragraph slice (`Slice([paragraph("Article Title"),
  paragraph("")], 1, 1)`). When `replaceSelection`'d into a
  `tag` (which our schema constrains to a single textblock
  inside a `card`), PM split the surrounding card at the
  paragraph boundary to accommodate the multi-paragraph
  slice — the existing tag/cite ended up separated with a
  floating card-boundary separator at the newline position,
  and the post-paste `scrollIntoView()` landed at the new
  doc-end (since the structural mutation moved the cursor
  to the synthesized split point's end-of-doc cascade).

  Fix: new `normalizeClipboardTextForPaste(text, parentTypeName)`
  helper in `paste-plugin.ts`. In single-line contexts
  (`tag`, `cite_paragraph`, `undertag`, `analytic`) it
  collapses whitespace runs (`\s+`) to single spaces and
  trims edges before the text reaches `buildPlainTextSlice`.
  In multi-paragraph contexts (`card_body`, `paragraph`, etc.)
  it returns the text unchanged so intentional paragraph
  splits in the clipboard still produce multi-paragraph
  slices.

  Wired into both plain-paste entry points: the browser
  `handlePaste` handler (when `plainPasteArmed` is set, e.g.
  F2 in the web edition) and the Electron-host
  `applyPlainPasteFromText` function (called from the
  desktop menu's "Paste as plain text" / native F2 mapping).

- **Nav pane: highlight follows the editor caret.** Previously
  the `.pmd-nav-item-selected` blue highlight was driven purely
  by click events on the nav-pane (`selectSingle` / shift-click
  range / ctrl-click toggle); editor caret movements didn't
  update it. New `NavigationPanel.setCaretHeading(pos)` finds
  the heading whose section contains the caret (= largest
  `entry.pos <= pos` from the rendered `liEntries`) and calls
  `selectSingle` on it. Wired from `index.ts`'s
  `dispatchTransaction`, gated on `prevState.selection.from !==
  next.selection.from` so doc-only transactions away from the
  cursor don't pay the find-heading walk.

  Caret-tracking always produces a single selection — explicit
  multi-select via Ctrl/Shift-click still works for drag-and-
  drop and similar workflows, but collapses on the next caret
  movement. Matches the user mental model that the nav-pane
  reflects "where the cursor is."

  Doesn't auto-scroll the nav pane to bring the highlight into
  view — explicit decision; auto-scrolling on every cursor move
  would dominate the user's scroll behavior on long docs. Worth
  revisiting if it turns out users want it for outline-following
  workflows.

  Edge cases:
  - Caret before the first heading → `clearSelection()`, no
    highlight.
  - Caret inside a heading whose nav entry is hidden under a
    collapsed parent → the closest ancestor in `liEntries` gets
    highlighted (we iterate only rendered items).
  - Position drift between a doc edit and the next debounced
    `update()` (~200ms): the highlight may briefly point at a
    stale neighbor. Acceptable for a visual indicator.

- **Comments column: user-draggable width with resize handle.**
  Mirror of the nav-pane resize-handle pattern. New
  `commentsColumnWidth` setting (default 320, range 240–560)
  persists the width across sessions. CSS custom property
  `--pmd-comments-width` drives `.pmd-comments-column { width }`;
  the resize handle on the column's LEFT edge (the
  `right`-anchored opposite of the nav-pane's right-edge
  handle) updates the custom property during drag. Mouseup
  writes the final value to `settings`.

  Range chosen by squint: 240 px is the threshold below which
  thread cards start feeling cramped; 560 px is where the
  column starts eating too much of the editor width on a
  laptop. Same clamp in the settings sanitizer + the JS drag
  handler so persisted out-of-range values get pulled back in.

  The handle's bg is transparent at rest; tints on hover
  (`--pmd-c-accent-soft`) and during drag. Mirrors the
  nav-pane handle exactly — col-resize cursor on hover is the
  discovery cue, no permanent visible affordance. (An earlier
  iteration added a grip-dot indicator; removed when the user
  preferred the cleaner pattern of the nav-pane.)

- **Comments column: resize handle survives render() wipes.**
  Initial implementation appended the handle as a direct child
  of `#comments-column`. The column's `render()` method (fired
  from `dispatchTransaction` on every keystroke that affects
  comments state) does `this.root.innerHTML = ''` to rebuild
  threads from scratch, which wiped the handle along with
  everything else. User reported "can't see the resize handle"
  after typing — exactly the post-wipe state.

  Fix: introduce an inner `.pmd-comments-content` wrapper
  inside the column. `render()` now wipes that inner wrapper
  rather than the column root. The resize handle stays as a
  sibling of the wrapper (installed in the constructor BEFORE
  the wrapper, so DOM order is handle-then-content). Sticky
  positioning context for any column children remains the
  column itself (via `position: relative`); the inner wrapper
  is `height: 100%; width: 100%` so containment doesn't shift.

- **Comments column: full-scroll-extent layout via inner grid
  wrapper.** Same family of post-path-A regression as the
  multi-doc top-shift and recovery-sidebar offset that landed
  in alpha.3. With `#app` migrated to `position: fixed` +
  `overflow-y: auto` (the bounded scroller), the inner flex
  layout's cross-axis was viewport-bounded — items stretched
  to viewport, not to content height. The comments column's
  background only rendered at the top of the page and didn't
  cover the full scroll strip.

  Two-stage fix:
  1. `<div class="pmd-editor-row">` wrapper added inside `#app`
     in `index.html`, holding `#editor` + `#comments-column`.
     The flex / grid layout lives on this inner wrapper rather
     than `#app` itself.
  2. The wrapper uses `display: grid; grid-template-columns:
     1fr auto`. Initial attempt was flex with `min-height:
     100%`, but flex's cross-size determination floors at
     `min-height` and doesn't grow with overflowing items
     (measured: wrapper box 807px while `#editor.scrollHeight`
     was 5971px). Grid track sizing is content-based and
     handles this case cleanly — items end up content-tall
     (≈ 5982px on a long doc), the column's background covers
     the full scroll strip.

  Short / empty document case (separate issue surfaced in
  testing): with `grid-auto-rows: max-content`, an empty doc
  produced a short track and the column rendered as a small
  strip at the top of the visible area with empty space below.
  Fixed by NOT setting an explicit `grid-template-rows`
  initially, then trying `minmax(100%, max-content)` (collapsed
  to 100% per CSS Grid spec's "treat percentages as auto when
  the container's size depends on its tracks" rule, regressing
  the long-doc fix). Final shape: no explicit `grid-template-
  rows`; track auto-sizes. Combined with `min-height: 100%` on
  the wrapper, this gives items max(viewport, content) cross-
  size in both cases.

  Hidden in multi-doc layout via
  `body.pmd-multi-doc .pmd-editor-row { display: none }` —
  multi-pane's per-pane shell sits as a sibling of the wrapper
  and uses its own internal layout.

- **Comments column: bottom-left collapse/expand toggle removed.**
  The `.pmd-comments-toggle-active` button (▾/▴ circle pinned
  with `position: sticky; bottom: 0.5rem`) is gone. Removed:
  the `renderToggle` method, its call site in `render()`, the
  "skip click on toggle" branch in the sticky-dismiss handler,
  the `lastActiveThreadId` field + assignments (only the
  toggle button used it for "re-expand most recent thread"),
  and the three CSS rules for the button.

  Active-comment collapse still works — the sticky-dismiss
  global mousedown handler still dismisses when the user
  clicks outside the active card. The lost affordance is the
  "explicitly re-expand the most recently active thread"
  button-click; users now click the card they want to re-open.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3 — 2026-05-21

- **Auto-update check on launch (opt-in).** New setting
  `checkForUpdatesOnLaunch`, off by default in this release.
  When on, the first window of an app session triggers a silent
  update check during boot (gated on `host.isFirstWindow()`,
  same pattern as the doc-recovery UI — subsequent windows in
  the same session skip the check). If `update-available` fires,
  the same modal the manual Help → Check for Updates path uses
  pops up with "Open release page" + "Close" buttons; the
  "Open release page" button calls `shell.openExternal` to deep-
  link to `https://github.com/ant981228/cardmirror/releases/tag/v$VERSION`
  in the user's default browser. Errors and "you're current"
  outcomes stay silent on this path — the wishlist explicitly
  flagged that surfacing them every launch would be obnoxious
  for users who happen to be offline at boot.

  Implementation:
  - Renderer-driven trigger: a new
    `host:trigger-auto-update-check` IPC handler in `main.ts`
    calls a shared `runUpdateCheck(opts)` function with
    `{ alertOnLatest: false, alertOnError: false }`. The same
    function backs the manual Help-menu path with
    `{ alertOnLatest: true, alertOnError: true }`.
  - Shared `showUpdateAvailableDialog(info)` helper holds the
    modal definition, so the available-update dialog is
    byte-identical between manual and auto-launch paths.
  - Single `updateCheckInFlight` guard prevents the manual and
    auto paths from racing if they happen to overlap (e.g.,
    user clicks Help menu before the boot check completes).
  - `startAutoUpdate` no longer calls `checkForUpdates()`
    itself — the renderer owns the at-launch trigger now,
    gated on the setting + `isFirstWindow()`. The persistent
    `update-downloaded` handler stays in `startAutoUpdate` so
    the "Update ready, restart now?" dialog still fires when
    the background download completes (regardless of whether
    the trigger came from manual, auto-launch, or the Settings-
    panel button).
  - Setting toggle lives in `buildInstallInfoSection` (Settings
    → General → "About this install") via a plain checkbox
    above the existing Check-for-updates / Open-crash-dumps
    action buttons. Electron-only (web edition has no update
    mechanism).

- **Manual update check: three-dialog feedback.** The Help →
  Check for Updates click handler in `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`
  used to register only an `update-not-available` handler;
  `update-available` and `error` paths were silent (auto-update
  proceeded in the background, errors went to `console.warn`).
  Replaced the inline click handler with a `runManualUpdateCheck()`
  function that registers `.once` handlers for all three events
  plus a `catch` on the `checkForUpdates()` promise, with a
  mutual-cleanup pattern so exactly one dialog fires per check.
  Dialogs:
  - **Not available**: "You're on the latest version." + version.
  - **Available**: "Update available: vX.Y.Z." With buttons
    "Open release page" (deep-links to the tag's release page via
    `shell.openExternal`) and "Close." The download still proceeds
    in the background via the persistent `startAutoUpdate`
    handlers, which will show the existing "Update ready,
    restart now?" dialog when finished.
  - **Error**: "Couldn't check for updates: <message>" with the
    Releases URL as a manual-download fallback.
  Re-entrancy guard (`manualCheckInFlight`) prevents rapid double-
  clicks from registering duplicate handler sets. Auto-check
  errors on launch still go to `console.warn` per the wishlist —
  popping a dialog on every offline boot would be obnoxious.

- **`getFocusedWindow()` null guard via `dialogParentWindow()`.**
  Both the manual update-check dialogs above and the existing
  startAutoUpdate `update-downloaded` handler look up the dialog
  parent via `BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()`. If the user
  alt-tabs away between clicking "Check for Updates" and the
  response arriving, that returns `null` and the previous code
  silently early-returned, dropping the dialog on the floor.
  Centralized the lookup in `dialogParentWindow()` which falls
  back to `BrowserWindow.getAllWindows()[0]` — worst case the
  dialog attaches to "some" CardMirror window instead of the
  focused one, which is far better than the dialog never
  appearing.

- **About panel surfaces Chromium and Electron versions.**
  `src/editor/install-info.ts` parses `Chrome/X.Y.Z` and
  `Electron/A.B.C` out of `navigator.userAgent` and lists them
  as their own labelled rows above the full UA string. The
  underlying versions were already discoverable by reading the
  UA, but separate rows make "is the user actually running the
  version they think they are?" a one-line check during bug
  triage. Web edition shows Chromium but no Electron row.

  Context for this: a user-reported "Linux build shows version
  0.1.0-alpha.1 on alpha.2 install" bug whose code-path
  investigation came back clean — `pkg.version` is Vite-inlined
  from the root `package.json` at build time, the alpha.2 tag's
  `package.json` was `0.1.0-alpha.2`, the AppImage filename
  itself is `cardmirror-0.1.0-alpha.2.AppImage`. The most plausible
  explanation is the user had an earlier alpha.1 AppImage still
  installed (AppImages don't auto-update). Adding the separate
  version rows is the defensive measure that makes future
  version-mismatch confusion easier to diagnose.

- **Release workflow: two-stage to avoid the matrix-race.**
  alpha.2's release produced two separate drafts because the
  three OS matrix jobs concurrently saw "no release for this tag"
  and each created its own — Mac + Windows assets ended up on
  one draft and Linux's on another, requiring manual
  reconciliation. New `prepare-release` job runs first on a
  single Ubuntu runner, idempotently creates a draft release via
  `gh release create $TAG --draft --title $TAG --generate-notes`
  (no-op if a release for the tag already exists), and the
  `build` matrix job `needs: prepare-release` so it never starts
  until the draft is in place. electron-builder's GitHub
  provider then finds the existing draft and uploads to it
  instead of racing to create one.

- **Single-doc scroll container migrated from `body` to `#app`.**
  Diagnosis: a multi-trace investigation (Mac Electron, Mac Chrome,
  Linux Chrome, with and without `--enable-skia-graphite`) plus a
  layer-tree audit on macOS pinned single-doc's continuous heavy
  `UpdateLayer` cost during scrolling to the document being the
  rootScroller. The DevTools Layers panel showed `#document` at
  2206 × 558272 px, ~4.9 GB nominal memory, compositing reason
  *"Is the document.rootScroller. Is a scrollable overflow element
  using accelerated scrolling."* Every scroll position change
  triggered a recomposition of that giant layer. Trace-data
  signature: 10 big (>100 ms) `UpdateLayer` events spread across
  a 13 s scroll session in single-doc vs. zero in multi-pane
  (which already used the bounded `.pmd-pane-body` scroller).

  Fix: scope a new `body:not(.pmd-multi-doc) #app` rule that pins
  `#app` to the chrome-clipped viewport rectangle via
  `position: fixed` (top/left/right/bottom set from the existing
  `--ribbon-height` / `--nav-width` / `--status-bar-height`
  tokens) and gives it `overflow-y: auto` + `overscroll-behavior:
  contain`. The editor + comments column scroll *inside* `#app`;
  `body` stops being the rootScroller; the composited scrollable
  layer is bounded by `#app`'s viewport-sized box instead of the
  doc-content height. Multi-doc layout is untouched — it has its
  own `body.pmd-multi-doc #app` rule that already pins height and
  manages overflow via per-pane `.pmd-pane-body` scrollers.

  Companion changes:
  - `body.pmd-speech-banner-visible:not(.pmd-multi-doc) #app` now
    adjusts `top:` instead of `margin-top:` (multi-doc never
    surfaces the banner, so this is single-doc-only).
  - The dark-chrome-light-document background paint extends to
    `#app` (was `.pmd-pane-editor` + `.pmd-pane-body` previously) —
    container backgrounds in `overflow: auto` cover the full
    scrollable extent at every scroll position, so any gap below
    the editor's content extent now reads as light rather than
    dark.
  - `index.ts` reset path: `appEl.scrollTop = 0` replaces
    `window.scrollTo(0, 0)` in the doc-open scroll-to-top sequence.
  - `precise-scroll.ts` `desiredTop` now reads from the nearest
    scrolling-overflow ancestor's `getBoundingClientRect()` instead
    of `window.innerHeight`. Falls back to viewport bounds when
    no scroller is found (tests, detached nodes). This keeps the
    convergence math working across single-doc (`#app`), multi-pane
    (`.pmd-pane-body`), and any future container.

  Verified end-to-end: typecheck + 683 tests pass. Most scroll-
  path call sites needed no changes — `tr.scrollIntoView()` (the
  PM Transaction method) walks up from the selection's DOM to
  find the nearest scrolling ancestor; element-level `scrollIntoView`
  does the same; `drag-editor-surface.ts`'s host-relative math
  was already 0 in single-doc and stays so.

  Standalone, this fix narrowed but didn't close the macOS gap
  (see Electron bump entry below for the second half of the
  story).

- **Electron bumped from 33 (Chromium 130) to 42 (Chromium 148).**
  Second half of the macOS scroll-perf fix. The path A
  architectural change above eliminated the doc-as-rootScroller
  giant layer in single-doc, but the residual gap to the same
  content rendered in the user's installed Chrome 148 remained —
  measured most acutely as click-jump tail latency
  (electron-multi p99 frame interval 974ms vs chrome-multi 343ms
  on identical content + hardware) and per-event `UpdateLayer`
  cost magnitude (electron-single avg 472ms vs chrome-single
  78ms). Trace data attributed the gap to Chromium 130's
  compositor pipeline being more tightly coupled to main-thread
  work than 148's — Chrome did similar total work per scroll but
  produced frames smoothly through it, while Electron 130
  blocked frame production on the heavy work.

  GPU-feature-status diff between the two builds on the same Mac
  landed cleanly on one line:
  `skia_graphite: disabled_off` (Electron 33) vs `Enabled`
  (Chrome 148). Skia Graphite is the newer Dawn-on-Metal Skia
  backend that ships the relevant compositor decoupling. The
  `--enable-skia-graphite` switch we added to `main.ts` engaged
  the feature in Electron 33 (verified by re-running the GPU diff
  post-switch) but the M130 iteration of Graphite is two cycles
  pre-default-on; engaging the flag helped substantially but
  didn't reach Chrome 148's behavior. The actual cure was
  upgrading to a Chromium build that ships the mature Graphite
  implementation.

  Electron 42's bundled Chromium is `148.0.7778.96`, effectively
  matching the user's installed Chrome 148.0.7778.168 — maximum
  apples-to-apples perf parity. Bumps:
  - `electron`: `^33.2.0` → `^42.2.0` (9 major version jump)
  - `electron-builder`: `^25.1.8` → `^26.8.1`
  - `electron-updater`: `^6.3.9` → `^6.8.3`
  - `electronVersion` in build config: `33.2.0` → `42.2.0`

  Migration was uneventful: full `rm -rf node_modules
  package-lock.json && npm install`, `npm run build:main` clean
  against Electron 42 types (no main-process API breakages
  caught by tsc against the 9-major delta), renderer typecheck +
  683 vitest tests still pass. End-user verification on the Mac
  confirmed the perf gap closed — scrolling, typing, and
  nav-pane click latency now feel parity with the in-browser
  experience.

  The `--enable-skia-graphite` switch we added during the
  investigation is now a no-op on Electron 42 (Graphite is
  default-on for Apple in Chromium 148) but stays in place as
  belt-and-suspenders. The "Copy GPU Info" menu item that was
  added as a temporary diagnostic stays as a permanent
  bug-report aid — one click, zero runtime cost.

- **Keyboard Shortcuts cheat sheet caught up with the keybindings
  registry.** The `GROUPS` array in `src/editor/reference-ui.ts`
  was hand-maintained and had drifted behind the registry — alpha.2
  added twenty-some new bindable commands (the twelve previously
  click-only ribbon actions plus `zoomIn` / `zoomOut` / `zoomReset` /
  `chromeScaleUp` / `chromeScaleDown` / `chromeScaleReset` /
  `togglePaintbrushHighlight` / `togglePaintbrushShading` /
  `openFind` / `openFindReplace` / `openFindByProximity` /
  `toggleNavPane`) and none of them appeared in the cheat sheet.
  Two changes:

  1. **Expanded GROUPS to cover every `RIBBON_COMMAND_ID`.** Added
     three new categories — `Color pickers & menus`, `Find`,
     `Zoom & scale` — and slotted the missing commands into
     existing categories (`save` and `toggleAutosave` into File,
     `insertImage` into Editing utilities, paintbrush toggles into
     Highlight tools, the picker openers into the new Color pickers
     & menus group, etc.).
  2. **Module-init drift guard** asserts every `RIBBON_COMMAND_ID`
     appears in exactly one group. Throws on load if anyone adds a
     new command to the registry and forgets the cheat-sheet
     update, or accidentally lists the same command in two groups.
     Error message names the missing / duplicated / extra ids so
     the fix is obvious from the stack trace.

  Verified end-to-end via CDP: 86 rows across 17 groups (was 14
  groups and a smaller subset before; the previous version was
  missing ~26 commands). Module init returned `ok` rather than
  throwing, confirming the assertion accepts the current registry.
  Unbound commands continue to display `—` (we briefly shipped
  `(no shortcut)` instead; reverted at user request because it was
  too noisy with ~46 unbound commands).

- **New setting: Format nav pane entries by type** (Settings →
  Appearance, default on). Wishlist follow-up to the dark-mode
  nav-pane flatten-to-white tweak: some users find the per-level
  font weight cascade (700 → 600 → 500 → normal) and the analytic-
  blue label accent noisy and prefer a uniform list keyed only on
  indentation. Implementation:
  - New `formatNavPaneByType: boolean` field on `Settings`,
    default `true`, sanitized in `loadSettings` so missing-or-
    truthy is treated as on and explicit-`false` as off.
  - `SETTING_METADATA` entry under category `appearance` next to
    `showDocNameChip`, so it lands in Settings → Appearance with
    the other nav / chrome toggles.
  - `applyFormatNavPaneByType(on)` in `index.ts` toggles
    `html.pmd-nav-flat` (class present when the toggle is OFF;
    parallels `pmd-doc-name-chip-on` / `pmd-nav-hidden`). Called
    at module init and from the settings subscriber so live
    toggling works.
  - CSS rules in `style.css` near the existing per-level rules:
    when `html.pmd-nav-flat` is set, `.pmd-nav-level-{1,2,3,4}`
    collapse to `font-weight: normal`, `font-size: 0.85rem`,
    `color: var(--pmd-c-text)`, and
    `.pmd-nav-type-analytic .pmd-nav-label` inherits instead of
    forcing the analytic-blue accent. Padding-left rules are
    untouched — indentation is the surviving hierarchy cue.
  - The dark-mode nav-pane-flatten-to-white rule still wins
    inside dark mode because it carries the higher-specificity
    `:root[data-theme="dark"] :is(.pmd-nav-panel, .pmd-multi-nav)`
    chain — both rules want uniform color anyway, so the cascade
    interaction is by design.
  Verified end-to-end via CDP on the 1NC v. Dartmouth doc: with
  `pmd-nav-flat` set, level-1 / 2 / 3 entries all report
  `font-weight: 400`, `font-size: 13.6px`; default state has 700 /
  600 / 500.

- **Scroll chaining from the nav pane no longer bleeds into the
  editor.** With the pointer over the nav pane, scrolling past its
  top or bottom limit would propagate the leftover wheel delta to
  the body's scroll container (single-doc) or the multi-pane row.
  Once the browser picked the editor as the gesture's scroll
  target, reversing direction kept scrolling the editor until the
  user paused fully and started a new gesture. Fix: add
  `overscroll-behavior: contain` on the two `overflow-y: auto`
  containers that own the nav and pane scrolls — `.pmd-nav-list`
  and `.pmd-pane-body` (multi-pane). `contain` cuts the scroll
  chain at the element's boundary, which also kills the "sticky
  target" follow-up because the chain never starts. Single-doc
  editor scrolls on the body / html, which has no ancestor scroll
  container to chain into, so no symmetric change needed there.
  Verified: `getComputedStyle(.pmd-nav-list).overscrollBehaviorY ===
  "contain"` post-fix.

- **Dark mode: end-to-end readability guarantee on imported docs.**
  Reported against the Health Care Topic Area Paper and 1NC v.
  Dartmouth CG docxs: with Settings → Appearance → Theme: Dark
  and "Apply theme to the document area" enabled, large swaths
  of body text were invisible (literal black on dark), shading-
  background text was invisible (themed white on yellow shading
  from Verbatim's `HighlightToBackgroundColor` macro), and
  hyperlinks were either browser-default `#0000EE` blue or
  Word's `#0563C1` — neither readable on `#1a1a1a`. Four
  coordinated changes in `src/schema/marks.ts` and
  `src/editor/style.css`:

  1. **`font_color="000000"` skip-inline-style.** The
     `000000` sentinel emits only `data-color="000000"` (no
     `style="color: #000000"`). The run inherits the
     surrounding text color: near-black via `--pmd-c-text` in
     light mode, `#e6e6e6` in dark mode, whatever the user
     picked in the per-token-override panel.

  2. **`colorBand(hex)` helper + `data-color-band` /
     `data-shading-band` attributes.** New exported helper
     classifies a 6-hex RGB into `dark` (perceived luminance
     `(0.299r + 0.587g + 0.114b) / 255 < 0.4`) or `light`.
     `font_color` and `shading` `toDOM` each emit a band
     attribute on the rendered span. Threshold tuned so the
     common Word sentinels — `000000` (lum 0), `0563C1`
     hyperlink blue (~0.32), dark grays / reds — land in
     `dark`, and mid-gray (`888888` ~0.53) onward stays
     `light` (user-intentional choices preserved).

  3. **Shading mandates contrast like highlight does.** CSS:
     `.ProseMirror [data-shading-band="light"] { color: #000; }`
     and the dark counterpart. Mirrors the per-named-color
     rules on `.pmd-highlight` for arbitrary hex shading.
     Always-on (not dark-mode-gated) because shading is doc
     data and needs contrast in any theme.

  4. **`--pmd-c-link` token + dark-band override + container
     scoping.** Light mode `#0563C1` (matches Word); dark
     mode `#7AB0FF` (bright sky blue, ~0.71 luminance).
     `.ProseMirror a` uses the token with `!important` so it
     beats the canonical Word-blue `font_color` marks Word
     stamps onto hyperlink runs. In dark mode + apply-to-doc,
     `[data-color-band="dark"]` falls back to `--pmd-c-text`
     via `!important`, catching dark-band font_color marks
     anywhere in the doc. Three higher-specificity rules
     reverse the override inside `.pmd-highlight`,
     `[data-shading-band]`, and `<a>` so those containers'
     mandated colors win (otherwise the override would make
     yellow-shaded text white-on-yellow, etc.).

  Round-trip unchanged: exporter reads `attrs.color`,
  importer / `parseDOM` read `data-color` / `data-shading`,
  neither touches inline style or `data-*-band`.

  Verified end-to-end via CDP on the 1NC v. Dartmouth doc:
  108/108 shading runs compute high-contrast (`color: #000` on
  the yellow shading), all 503 highlight runs compute
  high-contrast per their named highlight, 9/16 link runs
  render in sky blue and 7 render black because they sit
  inside `.pmd-highlight` spans where black-on-yellow contrast
  takes priority over link visibility (acceptable — the
  highlight rule already preserves readability and the link
  is still clickable). Six new test cases in
  `tests/schema/schema.test.ts` lock the contracts: the
  `000000` style skip, the `data-color-band` luminance buckets
  (`000000`/`0563C1`/`FF0000` → `dark`; `888888`/`FFFFFF`/
  `FFFF00` → `light`), and the shading band attribute on
  `toDOM`.

- **Underline color matches text color inside highlights and
  shading.** Follow-up to the dark-mode-readability work above.
  `.pmd-underline` / `.pmd-emphasis` are outer to highlight /
  shading in the mark stack (underline_mark at schema position 117,
  highlight at 311, shading at 271 — earlier-defined marks render
  outermost in the DOM). The text-decoration line is painted by the
  outermost element, and its `text-decoration-color` defaults to
  that element's `color` — which in dark mode is the themed light
  body text. So an underlined-highlighted run renders as black text
  on yellow (correct), with a white underline cutting through it
  (wrong). Added two `:has()` rule sets in `style.css` that set
  `text-decoration-color` on `.pmd-underline` / `.pmd-emphasis` (and
  `.pmd-cite` under the `citeUnderlined` flag) when they contain a
  highlight or shading band: black for light-band containers
  (yellow / green / cyan / magenta / red / lightGray highlight,
  `data-shading-band="light"`), white for dark-band containers
  (blue / darkBlue / darkCyan / darkGreen / darkMagenta / darkRed
  / darkYellow / darkGray / black highlight, `data-shading-band="dark"`).
  Verified on 1NC v. Dartmouth: 232 underline-inside-highlight/shading
  spans now paint `rgb(0, 0, 0)` underlines (correct against the
  yellow backgrounds in that doc); plain underlines outside any
  band still paint with themed body color so they read as light on
  the dark surface.

- **Native form controls render in dark mode.** The body-font
  dropdown in Settings → Appearance was painting its `<select>`
  with `var(--pmd-c-bg)` (dark in dark mode) but had no explicit
  text `color`, and the dropdown popup was being drawn by the
  browser in its OS-default light style — black option text on
  white in a UI surrounded by dark chrome. Two fixes: (1) set
  `color: var(--pmd-c-text)` on `.pmd-body-font-select` so the
  collapsed value is readable; (2) declare `color-scheme: dark`
  on `:root[data-theme="dark"]` so the browser draws every
  native form control (popup option lists, scrollbars, native
  date/color pickers, etc.) in its dark variant. Not gated on
  apply-to-document — native form controls only appear in chrome
  surfaces, never inside the ProseMirror editor, so the
  doc-area-stays-light mode doesn't need a light counterpart.
  Verified: `getComputedStyle(html).colorScheme === "dark"` and
  the select reports `color: rgb(230, 230, 230)` /
  `background: rgb(26, 26, 26)` in dark mode.

- **Sky-blue hyperlink color is now gated on apply-to-document.**
  Follow-up to the readability-guarantee work: the dark-mode
  `--pmd-c-link: #7AB0FF` override was set at `:root[data-theme=
  "dark"]` scope and so applied to the editor whenever the theme
  was dark — including when "Apply theme to the document area" was
  OFF and the document was rendering as light paper. Word's
  canonical hyperlink blue (`#0563C1`) is the right color against
  a white doc, so the sky-blue override leaked the wrong palette.
  Fix: add `--pmd-c-link: #0563C1` to the existing
  `:root[data-theme="dark"]:not([data-theme-doc="dark"]) :is(#editor,
  .pmd-pane-editor)` rule that already re-declares the other light-
  mode tokens for the editor scope when apply-to-doc is off. The
  chrome scope keeps `#7AB0FF` in dark mode (no chrome surface
  actually uses the token, but the symmetry is correct). Verified
  via CDP: dark + off → editor link computes `rgb(5, 99, 193)`;
  dark + on → editor link computes `rgb(122, 176, 255)`.

- **"Dark chrome, light document" mode actually paints the document
  area white, across the full scroll, in both single-doc and
  multi-pane.** The CSS rule that scopes light-mode-token
  redeclarations inside `:is(#editor, .pmd-pane-editor)` under
  `:root[data-theme="dark"]:not([data-theme-doc="dark"])` redefined
  `--pmd-c-bg: #fff` at the editor scope, but nothing in that rule
  applied the token to the editor's own paint — `#editor` /
  `.pmd-pane-editor` carry no `background` declaration of their own,
  so they inherited body's `background: var(--pmd-c-bg)` which
  resolves to `#1a1a1a` in dark mode. The editor read as black-on-
  dark even though the user explicitly opted OUT of "Apply theme to
  the document area." Two coordinated paints land the fix:

  1. **`background: var(--pmd-c-bg)` on `:is(#editor, .pmd-pane-editor)`**
     within the same scoped rule, so the scoped `--pmd-c-bg: #fff`
     actually applies to the editor's box. This covers single-doc
     entirely — `body` is its scroller, `#editor` sits inside the
     flex layout, and `#editor`'s painted box extends with the
     content.

  2. **`background: #fff` on `.pmd-pane-body`** in the same scoped
     rule. Multi-pane's per-pane editor surface (`.pmd-pane-editor`)
     is sized `height: 100%` of its parent `.pmd-pane-body` — which
     is the `overflow-y: auto` scroller bounded to the pane's
     viewport. So `.pmd-pane-editor`'s painted white box only
     covered the visible viewport portion; ProseMirror content
     overflows past that box and the dark `.pmd-pane-body` showed
     through under the overflowed content as the user scrolled.
     Painting `.pmd-pane-body` itself covers the full scrollable
     extent (container backgrounds in `overflow: auto` paint behind
     the visible viewport at every scroll position).

  The body / ribbon / nav / status-bar chrome around the editor
  stays dark because their backgrounds resolve `--pmd-c-bg` from
  the root scope (`#1a1a1a`) — the redeclare only escapes into the
  editor scope. Per-token Accessibility-panel overrides of
  `--pmd-c-bg` still win for single-doc because the `#editor`
  paint uses the token, not a literal hex.

- **Nav pane reads in solid white in dark mode.** The per-level grey
  cascade (level-4 → `--pmd-c-text-muted`, level-1/2/3 → inherited
  body text) and the analytic-blue label (`--pmd-color-analytic`)
  rendered as inconsistent dim entries against the dark chrome
  surface, and the "No headings." empty-state message disappeared
  into the background at `--pmd-c-text-faint` (#7a7a7a in dark
  mode). Added a dark-mode-scoped block that sets `color:
  var(--pmd-c-text-strong)` on the nav-panel container, the empty
  state, the level-4 entries, and the analytic label / hover —
  covering both single-doc (`.pmd-nav-panel`) and multi-pane
  (`.pmd-multi-nav`) layouts. Light mode is unchanged. The
  in-flight wishlist item "Setting: disable nav-pane formatting"
  will let users opt out of the per-type formatting in light mode
  too when shipped; this fix is the dark-mode-specific tactical
  flatten.

- **Web-edition Open button: selection no longer silently dropped.**
  Clicking the 📂 button on the web edition would open the OS
  file picker, let the user pick a file, then do nothing. `Ctrl-O`
  worked on the same page. Root cause: `BrowserHost.openOnce` had
  a focus-event-plus-200ms-setTimeout heuristic to detect
  cancellation — when the dialog closed and the window regained
  focus, the timer fired 200ms later and checked `input.files`.
  If the browser hadn't populated `input.files` by then (which
  varies with the previously-focused element — the button vs.
  editor — and with OS dialog implementation), the timer
  resolved the promise to `null`, then the actual `change` event
  fired but ran into `settled=true` and dropped on the floor.
  Keyboard `Mod-O` happened to win the race; mouse-button click
  reliably lost it on Chrome 148+ on Linux and on Zen (Firefox
  fork). Fix: replace the focus-and-timeout polling with the
  native `cancel` event (Chrome 113+, Firefox 91+, Safari 16.4+),
  which fires only when the user actually dismisses the picker
  without picking. No race. The byte-identical code in alpha.1
  was already buggy; nothing changed in this file between
  releases — what likely shifted was timing pressure elsewhere
  on the page (timer UI mount, dark-mode boot, find-replace
  decorations) that pushed the focus event past the
  `input.files` population threshold often enough that the
  symptom started manifesting reliably.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 — 2026-05-20

- **Nav-pane navigation: dramatically faster on big docs.**
  Clicking a heading in the nav pane used to pay a full-doc
  layout pass on every click — about 2 seconds on a 2000-card
  debate file, paid regardless of whether the destination was
  already on screen. The scroll algorithm now does an optimistic
  `scrollIntoView` against whatever layout state already exists,
  then iteratively refines (up to 10 frames) when cv:auto's
  placeholder heights caused the first try to land imprecisely.
  Result: clicks where the target heading is already visible
  cost a few ms; clicks into fresh regions of the doc pay only
  what cv:auto would have charged anyway for materializing the
  destination, instead of re-laying-out the entire doc each
  time. The per-keystroke editing-perf win from cv:auto is
  preserved end-to-end (we no longer flip it off at all).
- **Chrome scale — Mod-Alt-= / Mod-Alt-- / Mod-Alt-0.** Three
  new keybindable commands (`chromeScaleUp` / `chromeScaleDown`
  / `chromeScaleReset`) that scale the whole window — chrome
  AND doc content together — the same way the browser's built-
  in Ctrl-+ chord does. On Electron this drives Chromium's
  `webFrame.setZoomFactor`, so layout reflows at the new
  factor rather than just resizing pixels. Helpful on high-DPI
  displays where the chrome reads too small, or low-DPI where
  it crowds the editor. No-op on the web edition (use the
  browser's own page-zoom). No ribbon button — keyboard-only
  (the chord is shown in Settings → Keybindings and can be
  rebound). The editor's existing `Mod--` / `Mod-=` zoom stays
  separate, so you can dial doc content size up or down on top
  of the page-zoom factor.
- **Bug fix — Nav-pane drag drop-back precision.** When you grab
  a heading in the nav pane, the pane inserts thin drop-indicator
  bars between every entry to show valid drop slots. The cursor
  still followed the pickup pill, but the pile-of-indicators
  above the source heading pushed the source's slot down out from
  under the cursor — so releasing without moving (a "drop it back
  where it came from" gesture) landed the heading in a sibling
  slot instead. The source `<li>` now anchors at its original
  screen-Y for the duration of the drag, so a no-move release
  reliably drops back into the original slot. Other entries
  still shift down by the full indicator stack, so the nav pane
  still visibly expands at drag-start (the affordance you'd
  expect).
- **Bug fix — Multi-pane → single-window switch was losing open
  docs.** Toggling from the three-pane workspace back to one-doc-
  per-window only restored the active pane; the others were
  silently dropped. Root cause was a journal-write race: two IPC
  writes to the same crash-recovery file could land at once,
  producing a valid-JSON-then-garbage file that the post-reload
  reader threw out as corrupt. Writes are now serialized per uid
  and committed via an atomic rename, so journals stay valid even
  under concurrent edit-debounce + mode-switch traffic.
- **Accessibility — Reduce motion.** Settings → Accessibility →
  Reduce motion: System / On / Off. System (default) follows the
  OS `prefers-reduced-motion` preference. On flattens all
  animations and transitions in the UI (drag-pickup vacuum,
  popover slides, save-flash pulse, smooth scrolls) to effectively
  instant. Off forces full motion even when the OS asks for
  reduced — useful for users on an OS where the setting is
  always-on but they prefer animations in this app.
- **Accessibility — Body-font readability presets.** The Settings
  → Appearance → Body font dropdown now groups options by
  category, with "Recommended for readability" leading. Three
  bundled SIL OFL fonts ship with the app so every install has
  a readability-tuned choice regardless of what's on the host OS:
  **Atkinson Hyperlegible** (Braille Institute; designed for low
  vision, disambiguated letter pairs), **Lexend** (Font Bureau;
  the readability-tuned sans-serif with the strongest positive
  reading-speed evidence among "dyslexia fonts"), and
  **OpenDyslexic** (weighted-bottom shapes; preferred by some
  dyslexic readers — independent studies have NOT shown
  reading-speed improvements vs. Arial, but the option is
  popular). The British Dyslexia Association's 2023 endorsed
  system sans-serifs (Verdana, Tahoma, Comic Sans MS) follow
  when installed; remaining groups are "Microsoft Office
  defaults", "Apple defaults", "Open-source / cross-platform",
  and "Generic". Groups whose fonts aren't available are hidden.
- **"Open with CardMirror" actually opens the file on desktop.**
  `.docx` and `.cmir` are now registered file associations in the
  electron-builder config, so the installers wire up CardMirror
  as a right-click "Open with…" target (and as the default-app
  candidate for both extensions). The main process gained a
  single-instance lock plus open-file / second-instance / argv
  handling so double-clicking a registered file in Finder /
  Explorer / a file manager opens that file in CardMirror —
  spawning a new window when the app is already running, or
  launching directly into the file if the app wasn't open. Web
  edition unchanged.
- **Built-in countdown timer.** Native replacement for Verbatim's
  bundled timer. New ⏱ button in the right side of the ribbon
  (next to ⚙) toggles a timer panel into the ribbon's left edge.
  The panel has a big speech-timer display, Start/Pause, three
  speech-duration presets (default 9/6/3 minutes), Aff and Neg
  prep clocks (default 10 minutes each, blue and red), and a
  Reset column that re-fills the prep balances. Click a preset
  to load it (paused — hit ▶ to start). Click Aff or Neg to make
  that side's prep clock the active countdown. Type into the big
  display while paused to set a custom duration. Prep balances
  persist across closes; speech timer doesn't. Cross-window
  sync via BroadcastChannel — open the timer in two windows
  AND the visibility toggle in lockstep too: arming the panel
  in one window opens it in every CardMirror window. New
  Settings → Appearance entries:
  **Timer profile** (High school 3/5/8 + 8 min prep, College
  3/6/9 + 10 min prep, Pomodoro 25/15/5). Each profile's
  three preset durations and prep length are independently
  editable in Settings — pick a profile, then dial the four
  numbers to whatever your league actually uses. Switching
  profiles refills the prep clocks to that profile's total.
  **Compact timer layout** (drops the preset buttons, tucks
  Reset under Start). **Flash timer when countdown is low**
  (flashes the display red as remaining drops below 5 / 3 / 1
  seconds; the flash thresholds are editable too). **Prep
  side label** (Both / Text / Color) — controls how the Aff /
  Neg sides are labeled, with a color-only mode for a quieter
  panel.
- **"About this install" block at the bottom of Settings →
  General.** A read-only diagnostic section below a divider
  showing app version, host (Desktop / Web), operating system,
  and the full user-agent string — easy to copy-paste into a bug
  report. On desktop, two action buttons live underneath:
  **Check for updates** (mirrors Help → Check for Updates…,
  toast surfaces the result) and **Open crash dumps folder**
  (mirrors the Help-menu item) so both actions are now reachable
  from Settings.
- **Every ribbon action is now bindable.** Twelve previously
  click-only ribbon actions are now registered commands in the
  keybinding registry, available in Settings → Keybindings. None
  ship with a default binding — they're all already reachable via
  the ribbon, so a default chord would just be noise. The new
  bindable commands: increase / decrease font size by 1 pt,
  apply font color, open settings, toggle paragraph integrity,
  open each color picker dropdown (highlight / shading / font
  color), open the font-size picker, and open the doc / card /
  table tools menus.
- **Active doc filename in a ribbon pill (opt-in).** New Settings
  → Appearance → "Show doc name in ribbon" toggle (default off).
  When on, the active doc's filename appears as a pill centered in
  the ribbon between the comments toggle and the settings button.
  Useful on platforms / layouts where the OS title bar isn't
  visible: tiling window managers without decorations,
  hidden-title-bar themes, web edition embedded in another page,
  etc. Long filenames ellipsis-truncate with the full name in the
  tooltip. The chip hides when there's no filename yet
  (untitled / fresh doc before Save-As), in multi-pane mode (each
  per-pane chip already shows the slot's doc), and falls out of
  the ribbon's progressive-hide cascade between paragraph styles
  and the format-menu cluster when the ribbon runs out of room.
- **Multi-pane window title summarizes all open slots.** The OS
  window title in multi-pane mode used to show just the focused
  doc's filename. It now shows every non-empty slot's filename
  joined by `·` — e.g. "Foo · Bar — CardMirror" — so the title
  bar conveys the whole workspace at a glance rather than
  changing with every focus shift. Single-doc mode unchanged.
- **Fixed: Copy Last Cite now finds cite_mark text you just
  applied.** Adding the cite mark to a word in a body paragraph
  is supposed to promote that paragraph to a `cite_paragraph`
  (the cite classifier plugin does this automatically). But the
  classifier was gated on a "did the doc change?" range that
  excluded mark-only transactions — `AddMarkStep` doesn't shift
  any positions, so its step-map was empty and the classifier
  bailed early. Result: the paragraph stayed a regular
  `paragraph`, and Copy Last Cite fell through to whatever older
  `cite_paragraph` it could find further up the doc. The same
  silent-skip affected the named-style normalizer (it would
  miss underline/cite/emphasis conflicts created via mark-add
  transactions). Both now see mark-only transactions.
- **F8 / Apply Cite Style now expands to the word at the cursor**
  when there's no selection — matching the behavior F10 / Apply
  Emphasis Style already had. Previously pressing F8 with the
  cursor in a word silently did nothing; users had to double-click
  to select the word first.
- **Fixed: Underline / Emphasis font-size settings were dead.**
  Settings → Styles → font size for the Underline and Emphasis
  styles did write a CSS variable, but no CSS rule consumed it, so
  the change was silently dropped. The marks now pick up
  `--pmd-size-underline` / `--pmd-size-emphasis` and behave like the
  other per-style size knobs.
- **Image alt text is now editable and round-trips through Word.**
  Three changes that ship together:
  - Right-clicking an image shows a new **Edit alt text…** menu item
    (above the AI options, always enabled). Opens a multi-line dialog
    pre-filled with the current alt text; saving writes the new value
    back to the image node and survives docx export.
  - The OOXML importer now reads `wp:docPr@descr` (with `pic:cNvPr@descr`
    as a fallback for older producers) into `image.attrs.alt`. Previously
    the importer dropped alt text on the floor; exporting was the only
    half of the round-trip that worked.
  - The AI alt-text generator now updates `image.attrs.alt` as well as
    inserting the visible `[ALT TEXT: …]` bracket. If the image already
    has alt text on its attribute, the AI command pops a dialog
    showing the existing alt text and offers **Keep current** (copy it
    to a bracket below the image, no API call) or **Regenerate with
    AI** (overwrite both the attribute and the bracket).
- **Dark mode.** Settings → Appearance → Theme: Light / Dark /
  System (default). System mode tracks the OS-level
  `prefers-color-scheme` and switches live when the user changes
  their system appearance. Sibling toggle, **Apply theme to the
  document area**, defaults off — the chrome (ribbon, nav, status
  bar, settings panels) follows the dark theme but the document
  itself stays light / paper-like. Flip on for full dark. User
  per-token color overrides win over either theme via inline
  style on `<html>`.
- **Accessibility settings section** (new tab, far right of the
  Settings dialog).
  - Highlight + shading display overrides moved here from
    Appearance. Replaced the single-color picker with **1–3
    ordered slots** that map to source colors by usage
    frequency. Slot 1 → most-common color in the doc, slot 2 →
    second-most-common, last slot = catch-all for everything
    else. Frequency ranking is incremental + debounced, and
    inactive when only one slot is set, so big docs don't pay
    perf cost unless they're using the multi-color feature.
  - **Per-token color overrides** panel: every UI color in the
    interface (background, borders, accent, hover, status, find
    decorations, table chrome, etc.) is overridable with a
    color picker + alpha slider. Reset-per-row + reset-all
    affordances. Overrides win over the active theme and any
    future preset (high-contrast, colorblind-friendly, etc.).
- **Cursor-position color readout** on the status bar. Visible
  only when an override is on. Shows the ACTUAL stored colors on
  the run at the cursor ("Hl: Yellow · Sh: Protected Grey") so
  you don't lose awareness of what's encoded in the doc while
  the override hides it from view.
- New setting: **default file format for new docs**. Pick `.docx`
  (default — Word- / Verbatim-compatible) or `.cmir` (CardMirror's
  native format, enables autosave); the Save-As dialog defaults to
  that format for any doc that doesn't yet have an on-disk handle.
  Existing files on disk still re-save in whatever format they were
  opened from.
- New setting: **jump to doc top when read mode toggles**. Off by
  default (today's stay-put behavior). When on, toggling read mode
  in either direction scrolls to the top of the doc and places the
  cursor at the start.
- Zoom in / out / reset and the highlight / shading paint-mode
  toggles are now registered ribbon commands, so users can bind
  them to keys via Settings → Keybindings. Default bindings:
  `Mod-=` for zoom in, `Mod--` for zoom out; `zoomReset` and the
  paintbrush toggles ship unbound (`Mod-0` is a browser-level
  reset that Chromium won't always let the page intercept, so the
  status-bar reset button remains the discoverable affordance).
- Keyboard-shortcut command labels (Settings → Keybindings) now
  use consistent title casing across the board.
- **Find and Replace** (Ctrl-F / Ctrl-H / Alt-F). Floating bar in
  the upper-right with case-sensitive and whole-word toggles,
  next / prev navigation, a match count, Replace, and Replace
  All. Every match is highlighted in light yellow; the
  currently-active one gets a stronger orange band. Escape
  closes and restores editor focus.

  Result ordering:
  - **Ctrl-F** (categorized): hits in headings come first, then
    tags, then cites, then everything else. Within each group,
    the closest match to your cursor ranks first (cursor counts
    as the top — matches after wrap around to matches before).
    The category priority is reorderable in Settings → General.
  - **Alt-F** (proximity-only): ignores categories — just orders
    by proximity to the cursor.
  - **Ctrl-H** opens the find+replace bar with the same
    categorized ordering as Ctrl-F.

  Surfaces beyond the floating bar:
  - **Expandable results panel** below the bar — toggles open
    via a chevron, lists every match with surrounding context,
    and clicking an entry jumps to it. Open/closed state
    persists per session via `findResultsExpanded`.
  - **Nav-pane integration** — outline entries whose subtree
    contains a match get a small accent decoration, so you can
    see at a glance which sections of the doc match the current
    query without scrolling through results.
  - **Scope** — search can be restricted to a range (e.g. the
    current selection) instead of the whole doc. Toggling the
    scope chip clears it.
- Re-pressing a heading shortcut (F4 / F5 / F6 / F7 / Mod-F7 /
  Mod-F8) on a paragraph that already has that heading style now
  strips the paragraph's indentation while keeping the heading
  style and all other formatting intact, instead of being a
  no-op.
- Opening a doc now starts both the editor and the nav pane
  scrolled to the top, instead of inheriting the previous doc's
  scroll position.
- A "New document" window spawned while CardMirror is already
  running no longer offers to "recover" the docs you have open
  in other windows. Only the first window of an app session
  surfaces the startup-recovery sidebar.
- The navigation pane can now be hidden. Three ways to toggle:
  the new ☰ button in the View tools section of the ribbon, the
  × close button in the top-right of the nav pane itself, and a
  small pull-tab pinned to the left edge of the viewport (only
  visible when the nav pane is hidden). State is per-window; in
  multi-doc mode the toggle applies to all panes' nav at once.
- The word-count selection button (Σ) moved off the ribbon to
  the left edge of the status bar, next to the live read-aloud
  word counter — same family of question, fewer ribbon buttons.
- Zoom-strip controls (zoom in/out/reset + word-count) are
  slightly smaller and stay centered on the bar.
- Triple-click + drag now extends the selection paragraph-by-
  paragraph (instead of switching back to character-level on the
  first move). Matches Word and most browsers' contenteditable
  default.
- Right-clicking a link now opens a context menu (Open Link /
  Copy Link Address / Edit Link… / Remove Link). Open routes
  through the OS default browser via `shell.openExternal` on
  desktop; Edit reuses the in-app text prompt; Remove strips the
  link mark while preserving the text. Non-link right-clicks
  pass through to the browser / image context menu as before.
- Paint mode (highlight / shading paintbrush) now shows an I-beam
  precision cursor with a small swatch of the active color, so
  you can target characters precisely AND see which color the
  next paint will apply. Picking a new color while paint mode is
  armed updates the cursor live.
- Text selection inside the editor is now translucent (~30%
  alpha) instead of fully opaque, so the underlying highlight,
  shading, and other colors show through. Side effect: you can
  now tell at a glance whether selected text is currently
  highlighted (F11) — the highlight color shows through the
  selection overlay instead of being hidden by it.
- Clicking an image now shows a visible selected state — a 2px
  accent outline so it's obvious the click registered before
  pressing Delete / Copy. Unsupported-format placeholder spans
  also get a subtle background tint when selected.
- The caret no longer hides behind the fixed ribbon (top) or
  status bar (bottom) after Enter / arrow / new-heading actions.
  The browser's auto-scroll-into-view now reserves space for both
  fixed bars via `scroll-padding`.
- Legacy Verbatim character-style ids are now recognized on import
  — pre-modern distributions used `StyleBoldUnderline` for the
  underline mark and `StyleStyleBold12pt` for the cite mark. Files
  from those distributions (e.g. 2013-14 era debate evidence) now
  import with their underlining and cites intact instead of
  silently losing them. Export still normalizes to the current
  styleIds, so re-saving an old file cleans up the rStyle output.
- The AI alt-text generator now ships surrounding context with the
  image — the enclosing card's tag and cite, plus the paragraphs
  immediately before and after the image — so descriptions reflect
  what the image is *doing* in the argument instead of generic
  "a chart with bars" captions.
- Shift-F3 (cycle case) now keeps the selection after each press,
  so the user can re-press to advance to the next case state
  (lower → UPPER → Title → lower) without re-selecting.
- Speech-doc designation now uses the same warm-gold accent in both
  single-window multi-window mode (the banner under the ribbon) and
  single-window multi-pane mode (the per-pane chip), so the "this
  is the speech doc" affordance reads the same regardless of window
  topology.
- The window can now shrink to any size — the previous 800×600
  Electron floor is gone, so the status bar (zoom strip) stays
  on-screen on small / tiled / split-screen layouts. Ribbon
  panels hide progressively when there's literally no room left.
  The cascade is 11 steps, least-essential first: character
  styles → structural styles → doc-name chip → format menu →
  table / image / sub / sup / strike cluster → font-size step
  buttons → highlight + shading + font color panel → comments
  toggle + add-comment → file-ops buttons (Open / New / Save /
  Autosave) → read-mode + nav-pane toggle → settings gear +
  keyboard-shortcut button. The timer toggle (⏱) stays outside
  the cascade so it's always reachable mid-round. The hide/show
  is measurement-driven (not media-query breakpoints), so it
  adapts to chrome scale, OS font size, and which panels are
  even visible to begin with.
- Ribbon cleanup: the plain-paste toggle (`T`) is hidden on desktop
  (F2 reads the clipboard directly there — no armed state to show),
  and the autosave toggle (⏱) is hidden on the web edition
  (autosave requires an on-disk file handle, which the browser
  can't provide).

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — 2026-05-16

First downloadable preview of CardMirror. **This is an alpha.**
Expect bugs, missing features, and occasional breakage. Don't use
it for tournament-day work yet; keep a Verbatim copy of anything
important.

What works:

- Open and save Microsoft Word `.docx` files. Round-trips against
  Verbatim-format docs.
- Native `.cmir` format for lossless save / restore (no Word
  conversion costs, autosave-eligible).
- Verbatim-parity editing model: Pocket / Hat / Block / Tag /
  Analytic / Undertag styles, F-key shortcuts, condense /
  uncondense / case-toggle, emphasis / underline / highlight,
  shrink, send-to-speech, paste-as-plain.
- Multi-doc workspace — pick between a three-pane single-window
  layout or one window per doc.
- Send-to-speech across windows in multi-window mode.
- Per-doc read mode and autosave.
- Crash-recovery journal — unsaved drafts come back on next
  launch.
- Word-style left navigation pane: outline view, multi-select,
  drag-reorder.

Not in this release (planned):

- Full-text and schema-aware search across open docs / the
  evidence library on disk.
- Transclusion (live-linked content from a source doc).
- Cross-window drag-and-drop. (Cross-pane drag within multi-pane
  mode works.)

Operational:

- **Crash dumps** are collected locally to disk only — never
  uploaded anywhere. If CardMirror crashes and you want to send
  a report, open *Help → Open Crash Dumps Folder* and attach
  the minidump to a GitHub issue.
- **Auto-update**: on launch, CardMirror checks GitHub Releases
  for a newer version and downloads it in the background. When
  one's ready, a dialog asks whether to restart now or install
  on next quit. *Help → Check for Updates…* triggers the same
  check on demand.

Platforms:

- **macOS** — `.dmg` for Intel (x64) and Apple Silicon (arm64).
- **Windows** — NSIS installer (`.exe`) for x64.
- **Linux** — `.AppImage` (distribution-agnostic) and `.pacman`
  (Arch-native; install with `sudo pacman -U file.pacman`) for
  x64.

Known gaps:

- Desktop builds are unsigned. First-launch warnings on
  Windows (SmartScreen) and macOS (Gatekeeper) require a
  right-click → Open. See README.
